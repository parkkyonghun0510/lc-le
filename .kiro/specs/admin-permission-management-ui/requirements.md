# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive admin interface for managing the existing backend permission system. The backend already has a full RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system with permissions, roles, assignments, and matrix views, but lacks a frontend UI for administrators to manage these permissions effectively.

## Glossary

- **Permission_Management_System**: The frontend admin interface for managing permissions, roles, and user assignments
- **RBAC_Backend**: The existing backend Role-Based Access Control system with comprehensive APIs
- **Permission_Matrix**: A visual representation showing which roles have which permissions
- **Permission_Template**: Pre-configured sets of permissions for common role types
- **Scope_Level**: The access level (OWN, DEPARTMENT, BRANCH, ALL) for a permission

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view and manage all permissions in the system, so that I can control what actions users can perform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses the permissions page, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display a list of all available permissions with their names, descriptions, and categories
2. WHEN the administrator clicks create permission, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display a form to add new permissions with validation
3. WHEN the administrator edits a permission, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL allow modification of permission details and save changes to the RBAC_Backend
4. WHEN the administrator deletes a permission, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL prompt for confirmation and remove the permission if not assigned to any roles
5. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL provide search and filter capabilities for permissions by category and name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create and manage roles with specific permission sets, so that I can define user access levels efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses the roles page, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display all roles with their names, descriptions, and permission counts
2. WHEN the administrator creates a new role, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL provide a form to define role details and assign permissions
3. WHEN the administrator edits a role, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL allow modification of role permissions through a checkbox interface
4. WHEN the administrator assigns permissions to a role, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL support scope level selection for each permission
5. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL prevent deletion of roles that are currently assigned to users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to assign roles and permissions to users, so that I can control individual user access rights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses user permissions, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display all users with their current role assignments
2. WHEN the administrator assigns a role to a user, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL update the user's permissions immediately
3. WHEN the administrator removes a role from a user, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL prompt for confirmation and update permissions
4. WHEN the administrator views a user's permissions, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL show both role-based and direct permissions clearly
5. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL support bulk role assignment for multiple users simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view a permission matrix, so that I can understand which roles have access to which system functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses the permission matrix, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display a grid showing roles versus permissions
2. WHEN the administrator views the matrix, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL use visual indicators to show permission assignments and scope levels
3. WHEN the administrator clicks on a matrix cell, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL allow quick permission assignment or removal
4. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL provide filtering options to focus on specific permission categories or roles
5. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL support exporting the permission matrix for documentation purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use permission templates, so that I can quickly set up common role configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses permission templates, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display available templates with descriptions
2. WHEN the administrator applies a template to a role, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL assign all template permissions with appropriate scopes
3. WHEN the administrator creates a custom template, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL allow saving current role permissions as a reusable template
4. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL provide template categories for different organizational functions
5. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL allow template modification without affecting roles that previously used the template

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track permission changes, so that I can maintain security audit trails and accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission changes occur, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL log all modifications with timestamps and administrator details
2. WHEN the administrator views audit logs, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL display permission changes in chronological order
3. WHEN the administrator searches audit logs, THE Permission_Management_System SHALL support filtering by user, permission, role, and date range
4. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL show before and after states for permission modifications
5. THE Permission_Management_System SHALL retain audit logs for compliance and security review purposes
