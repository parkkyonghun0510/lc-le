## Implementation Status

✅ **Permission Management UI Complete!**

The admin permission management UI is fully implemented with:
- Full CRUD operations for permissions, roles, and user assignments
- Interactive permission matrix with visual indicators
- Role hierarchy management with bulk operations
- User permission assignment with search and filtering
- Permission templates for quick role setup
- Comprehensive audit trail with export capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design with accessibility support
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Error boundaries and loading states throughout

⚠️ **Migration Required!**

The new permission system is built but **not yet integrated** into the application. The app still uses old role-based checks (`isAdmin`, `isManager`, `user.role === 'admin'`) throughout.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the MIGRATION_PLAN.md document
2. Execute tasks 11.1-11.6 to migrate the application
3. Test thoroughly with different permission configurations
4. Remove old role-based checks once migration is complete

See `.kiro/specs/admin-permission-management-ui/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for detailed migration strategy.
