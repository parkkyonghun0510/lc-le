## What Was Built

### Backend Features:
1. **Smart Code Suggestion** - Analyzes existing codes and suggests next available
2. **Pattern Detection** - Supports sequential, prefix-based, and year-based patterns
3. **Availability Checking** - Real-time API endpoint to check if code is taken
4. **Bulk Generation** - Generate up to 100 codes for imports
5. **Enhanced Errors** - 409 responses include suggested code and existing employee info

### Frontend Features:
1. **Auto-fill** - Next available code automatically populated on modal open
2. **Real-time Checking** - Debounced availability check as user types
3. **Visual Indicators** - Green checkmark (available), red X (taken), spinner (checking)
4. **Smart Error Display** - Shows existing employee and suggested code

## The Problem We Solved

### Original Issue:
```
2025-10-16 10:18:56,944 - app.routers.employees - ERROR - 
Error creating employee: 409: Employee with code '0001' already exists
```

**User Experience:**
- Generic error message
- No guidance on what to do
- Manual trial-and-error to find available code
- Frustrating and time-consuming

### Solution Delivered:

**Scenario 1: Happy Path**
```
1. User opens "Create Employee" modal
2. Code "0002" is already filled in ✨
3. Green checkmark shows it's available ✅
4. User fills other fields and submits
5. Success! Employee created 🎉
```

**Scenario 2: Duplicate Detected**
```
1. User types "0001"
2. After 500ms, red X appears ❌
3. Alert shows: "Code taken by Admin (អ្នកគ្រប់គ្រង)"
4. Alert shows: "Suggested code: 0002" with [Use This Code] button
5. User clicks button
6. Code changes to "0002", green checkmark appears ✅
7. User submits successfully 🎉
```

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd le-backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd lc-workflow-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Scenarios:**
   - ✅ Open create employee modal → code auto-fills
   - ✅ Type available code → green checkmark appears
   - ✅ Type "0001" (existing) → red X appears
   - ✅ Submit with "0001" → error alert with suggestion
   - ✅ Click "Use Suggested Code" → code updates
   - ✅ Clear code field → "Suggest Code" button appears
   - ✅ Click "Suggest Code" → code fills in
   - ✅ Submit with available code → success

### API Testing:
```bash
# Get next code
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/employees/next-code \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Check availability
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/employees/check-code/0001 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Generate batch
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/employees/generate-codes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"count": 5}'
```
