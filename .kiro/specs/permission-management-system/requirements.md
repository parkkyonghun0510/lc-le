# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Permission Management System provides a comprehensive frontend UI for managing the existing backend RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system. This system enables administrators to manage permissions, roles, and user access through an intuitive interface, replacing hardcoded role checks with dynamic permission management. The system integrates with the existing workflow system and provides audit trails for all permission changes.

## Glossary

- **Permission Management System**: The frontend UI application for managing RBAC
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control system implemented in the backend
