- âœ… **React Hooks** (Tasks 5-8): All hooks implemented in `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts` and `src/hooks/usePermissionCheck.ts` with React Query caching, mutations, and permission checking functions
- âœ… **UI Components** (Tasks 9-11): 
  - PermissionTable with sorting, filtering, selection, and bulk action UI
  - PermissionMatrix with virtual scrolling and CSV export
  - RoleManagement with modal-based CRUD operations
  - UserPermissionAssignment with user search and role/permission management

### What Needs to Be Built:

**Core Functionality: 100% Complete! ðŸŽ‰**

The Permission Management System is fully implemented with all core features complete. The system provides comprehensive role-based permission management, individual permission management, user permission assignment, permission matrix visualization, and full audit trail tracking.

**Remaining Optional Task:**
- **Task 22: Bulk Operations Backend Integration** (Optional) - UI exists but needs backend API endpoint for bulk permission operations (activate, deactivate, delete). This is a nice-to-have enhancement that can be implemented based on user feedback.

### Optional Enhancements:
- âœ… **Draft saving** for forms (auto-save to localStorage) - COMPLETE
- âœ… **Browser compatibility detection** and warnings - COMPLETE
- ðŸ“‹ **Bulk operations backend integration** (Task 22) - UI exists, needs backend API endpoint for bulk activate/deactivate/delete permissions
