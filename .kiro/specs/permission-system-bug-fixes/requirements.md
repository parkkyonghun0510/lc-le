# Permission System Bug Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The recently implemented Permission Management System (Phase 3.1) has several critical runtime issues that prevent users from accessing and using the permission management features. These issues include hydration mismatches causing React errors, authorization failures preventing API access, and missing API endpoints. This specification addresses the immediate bug fixes needed to make the permission system fully functional.

## Glossary

- **Hydration**: The process where React attaches event handlers to server-rendered HTML
- **Permission System**: The role-based access control system for managing user permissions
- **API Client**: The frontend service layer that communicates with backend REST APIs
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy - browser security mechanism for controlling resource loading

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Permission Page Hydration Errors

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the permissions page to load without React errors, so that I can access the permission management interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the permissions page loads THEN the System SHALL render without hydration mismatch errors
2. WHEN tabs are rendered on the server THEN the System SHALL render identical content on the client
3. WHEN dynamic content is used THEN the System SHALL disable server-side rendering for that content
4. IF hydration errors occur THEN the System SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. WHEN the page is fully loaded THEN the System SHALL display all navigation tabs correctly

### Requirement 2: Resolve Permission API Authorization Errors

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to access permission management APIs, so that I can view and manage roles and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses `/api/v1/permissions/roles` THEN the System SHALL return HTTP 200 with role data
2. WHEN an admin user accesses `/api/v1/permissions/templates` THEN the System SHALL return HTTP 200 with template data
3. WHEN a non-admin user accesses permission APIs THEN the System SHALL return HTTP 403 with clear error message
4. IF the user lacks required permissions THEN the System SHALL specify which permission is needed
5. WHEN authentication tokens are sent THEN the System SHALL validate them correctly

### Requirement 3: Implement Missing Permission Matrix Endpoint

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view the permission matrix, so that I can see which roles have which permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing `/api/v1/permissions/matrix` THEN the System SHALL return HTTP 200 with matrix data
2. WHEN the matrix is requested THEN the System SHALL include all active roles and permissions
3. WHEN role-permission assignments exist THEN the System SHALL indicate them in the matrix
4. IF the user lacks VIEW_ALL permission THEN the System SHALL return HTTP 403
5. WHEN the matrix loads THEN the System SHALL format data for frontend consumption

### Requirement 4: Fix Permission Check Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the permission checking system to work correctly, so that users with appropriate permissions can access features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the System SHALL evaluate both role-based and direct permissions
2. WHEN a user has admin role THEN the System SHALL grant access to all permission management features
3. WHEN permission checks fail THEN the System SHALL provide clear feedback about missing permissions
4. IF permission data is not loaded THEN the System SHALL show loading state instead of denying access
5. WHEN permissions change THEN the System SHALL invalidate cached permission data

### Requirement 5: Resolve Content Security Policy Violations

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without security warnings, so that I have confidence in the system's security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external fonts are needed THEN the System SHALL load them from allowed sources only
2. WHEN CSP violations occur THEN the System SHALL log them for security review
3. WHEN font loading fails THEN the System SHALL fall back to system fonts gracefully
4. IF external resources are required THEN the System SHALL update CSP headers appropriately
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the System SHALL not display CSP violation errors in console

### Requirement 6: Improve Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when permission errors occur, so that I understand why I cannot access certain features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a 403 error occurs THEN the System SHALL display user-friendly message explaining the permission requirement
2. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the System SHALL indicate which endpoint is missing
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. IF permission checks fail THEN the System SHALL suggest contacting an administrator
5. WHEN errors are displayed THEN the System SHALL provide actionable next steps

### Requirement 7: Validate Permission System Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that all permission system components work together correctly, so that I can confidently use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to the permissions page THEN the System SHALL load all tabs without errors
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the System SHALL load appropriate data for each tab
3. WHEN performing permission operations THEN the System SHALL update the UI to reflect changes
4. IF backend services are unavailable THEN the System SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the system is healthy THEN the System SHALL allow full permission management functionality

### Requirement 8: Fix API Client Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API client to correctly handle authentication and authorization, so that API requests succeed when users have appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the System SHALL include valid authentication tokens
2. WHEN tokens expire THEN the System SHALL refresh them automatically
3. WHEN 401 errors occur THEN the System SHALL redirect to login page
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the System SHALL clear session and require re-authentication
5. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the System SHALL cache responses appropriately

### Requirement 9: Implement Permission Seeding for Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want default permissions and roles to be seeded in the database, so that I can test the permission system immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the System SHALL create default admin role with all permissions
2. WHEN seeding permissions THEN the System SHALL create SYSTEM.VIEW_ALL permission
3. WHEN seeding permissions THEN the System SHALL create SYSTEM.CREATE permission
4. IF permissions already exist THEN the System SHALL skip creation to avoid duplicates
5. WHEN admin user is created THEN the System SHALL assign admin role automatically

### Requirement 10: Add Permission System Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify the permission system is functioning correctly, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing health check endpoint THEN the System SHALL verify permission tables exist
2. WHEN checking system health THEN the System SHALL validate admin role and permissions exist
3. WHEN health checks run THEN the System SHALL verify API endpoints are accessible
4. IF health checks fail THEN the System SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN the system is healthy THEN the System SHALL return HTTP 200 with status details
