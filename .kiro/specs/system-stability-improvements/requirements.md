# System Stability Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Based on the analysis of existing markdown documents, the loan application system has several critical stability and functionality issues that need immediate attention. These issues range from backend 503 errors, folder organization problems, file upload inconsistencies, to incomplete CRUD operations. This spec addresses the systematic resolution of these issues to ensure a stable, reliable system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle file uploads and folder operations reliably, so that users don't encounter 503 Service Unavailable errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 200 status instead of 503
2. WHEN multiple parent folders exist for the same application THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single parent folder
3. WHEN the folder service encounters duplicate folders THEN the system SHALL merge child folders and files appropriately
4. IF folder creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback and clear error messages
5. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL handle the error without crashing

### Requirement 2: File Upload Parameter Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to properly process file upload parameters, so that files are correctly associated with folders and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded with folder_id parameter THEN the system SHALL associate the file with the specified folder
2. WHEN form data contains application_id THEN the system SHALL link the file to the correct application
3. WHEN upload parameters are sent as Form data THEN the backend SHALL read them correctly
4. IF folder_id is provided THEN the response SHALL include the same folder_id (not null)
5. WHEN parameter validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with descriptive error message

### Requirement 3: Folder Organization System

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want uploaded documents to be automatically organized into appropriate folders, so that I can easily find and review specific document types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a borrower document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL place it in "Borrower Documents" folder
2. WHEN a guarantor document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL place it in "Guarantor Documents" folder
3. WHEN a collateral document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL place it in "Collateral Documents" folder
4. IF a folder doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
5. WHEN the same document type is uploaded again THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing folder
6. WHEN viewing application details THEN files SHALL be displayed organized by folder

### Requirement 4: Database Integrity and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the system to maintain data integrity and clean up duplicate records, so that the database remains consistent and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate parent folders exist THEN the system SHALL identify and consolidate them
2. WHEN consolidating folders THEN the system SHALL preserve all child folders and files
3. WHEN removing duplicate folders THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. IF database cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL provide both automated and manual cleanup options
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify no data loss occurred

### Requirement 5: File Management CRUD Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want complete file management capabilities including create, read, update, and delete operations, so that I can manage application documents effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL support multiple file formats and validate file types
2. WHEN viewing files THEN the system SHALL display thumbnails for images and appropriate icons for documents
3. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL provide secure download links with proper authentication
4. WHEN deleting files THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and remove files from both database and storage
5. WHEN moving files between folders THEN the system SHALL update associations correctly

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about upload status and any errors, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload starts THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
2. WHEN an upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL display success message with folder information
3. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error message and suggested actions
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight specific issues and how to fix them

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the application to perform reliably under normal load, so that I can complete my work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users upload files simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without conflicts
2. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them without timeout errors
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN response times SHALL remain under 5 seconds for file operations
4. IF temporary failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry mechanisms
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance rather than fail

### Requirement 8: Data Consistency and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend and backend to maintain consistent data state, so that users see accurate information at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the file list SHALL refresh automatically to show new files
2. WHEN folders are created THEN the folder list SHALL update immediately
3. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data from the server
4. IF data synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual refresh options
5. WHEN viewing application details THEN the displayed files SHALL match the actual stored files

### Requirement 9: Mobile and Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the file upload and management features to work seamlessly on my device, so that I can complete applications from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN file upload SHALL work with camera capture
2. WHEN uploading from mobile THEN the system SHALL handle different file formats and orientations
3. WHEN viewing files on mobile THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
4. IF mobile network is slow THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and optimization
5. WHEN switching between devices THEN file organization SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 10: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want file operations to be secure and properly authenticated, so that sensitive loan documents are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL verify user authentication and authorization
2. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL use secure, time-limited URLs
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL validate file types and scan for malicious content
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
5. WHEN handling sensitive documents THEN the system SHALL encrypt data in transit and at rest
