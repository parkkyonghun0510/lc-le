# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing user management system to include enterprise-grade capabilities that are standard in organizational systems. The current system has a solid foundation with CRUD operations, role-based access, and organizational hierarchy, but lacks critical features like bulk operations, comprehensive audit trails, advanced analytics, and user lifecycle management. This enhancement will transform the system from a basic user management tool into a comprehensive enterprise solution that can scale efficiently and meet compliance requirements.
