# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing user management system to include enterprise-grade capabilities that are standard in organizational systems. The current system has a solid foundation with CRUD operations, role-based access, and organizational hierarchy, but lacks critical features like bulk operations, comprehensive audit trails, advanced analytics, and user lifecycle management. This enhancement will transform the system from a basic user management tool into a comprehensive enterprise solution that can scale efficiently and meet compliance requirements.

## Requirements

2. WHEN an administrator chooses bulk status update THEN the system SHALL allow changing status for all selected users simultaneously
3. WHEN an administrator initiates bulk export THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file containing user data with configurable columns
4. WHEN an administrator uploads a CSV file for bulk import THEN the system SHALL validate the data and create/update users accordingly
5. IF bulk import contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with line-by-line feedback
6. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log all changes for audit purposes

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Audit System

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to track all user management activities, so that I can maintain proper audit trails and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user logs in or out THEN the system SHALL track the activity with timestamp and IP address
3. WHEN an administrator views audit logs THEN the system SHALL display filterable history with user, action, timestamp, and details
4. WHEN audit data is requested THEN the system SHALL support exporting audit trails in multiple formats
5. IF sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication before logging
6. WHEN audit logs reach retention limits THEN the system SHALL archive old records according to policy

### Requirement 3: Enhanced User Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to view user activity analytics and organizational metrics, so that I can make informed decisions about user management and organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager accesses the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display user activity metrics including login frequency and last activity
2. WHEN viewing organizational metrics THEN the system SHALL show user distribution by branch, department, and role
3. WHEN analyzing user patterns THEN the system SHALL provide charts showing active vs inactive users over time
4. WHEN examining organizational structure THEN the system SHALL display an interactive organizational chart
5. IF performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL show user productivity indicators where available
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow exporting analytics data in PDF and Excel formats

### Requirement 4: Advanced Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want advanced search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find specific users or groups of users based on multiple criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for users THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, role, branch, department, and date ranges
2. WHEN using advanced search THEN the system SHALL allow combining multiple filter criteria with AND/OR logic
3. WHEN searching by activity THEN the system SHALL filter users by last login date, creation date, and modification date
4. WHEN saving search criteria THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to save frequently used filter combinations
5. IF search results are extensive THEN the system SHALL provide pagination and sorting options
6. WHEN exporting filtered results THEN the system SHALL maintain the applied filters in the export

### Requirement 5: User Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want structured user lifecycle processes, so that I can ensure proper onboarding and offboarding procedures are followed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL support onboarding workflows with status tracking
2. WHEN a user leaves the organization THEN the system SHALL provide offboarding checklists and data retention options
3. WHEN user status changes THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate notifications to relevant stakeholders
4. WHEN onboarding is incomplete THEN the system SHALL send reminders and track pending tasks
5. IF user accounts need temporary suspension THEN the system SHALL support scheduled activation/deactivation
6. WHEN lifecycle events occur THEN the system SHALL automatically update user permissions and access rights

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Status Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want more granular user status options with workflow support, so that I can better manage user states throughout their lifecycle.

5. IF users are Archived THEN the system SHALL maintain historical records while removing active access
6. WHEN status changes are made THEN the system SHALL require reason codes and optional comments

### Requirement 7: Improved User Experience

**User Story:** As a daily user of the system, I want better error messages and user interface improvements, so that I can work more efficiently with fewer frustrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
