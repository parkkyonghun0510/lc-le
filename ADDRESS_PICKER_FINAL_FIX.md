# Address Picker - Final Fix for Memory Issue

## Problem Identified
The address picker was showing the selected address in the preview (bottom of modal) but the dropdowns were empty. This happened because:

1. When `initialAddress` was loaded, it would set the province
2. Setting the province triggered a `useEffect` that cleared district, commune, and village
3. Then it would try to set district, but that cleared commune and village
4. This cascade of clearing prevented the full address from loading

## Solution: Initialization Flag

Added an `isInitializing` flag to prevent the cascade clearing during initial load.

### Changes Made

**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/AddressPicker.tsx`

#### 1. Added Initialization State
```typescript
const [isInitializing, setIsInitializing] = useState(false);
```

#### 2. Refactored Initialization Logic
Instead of setting selections one by one (which triggered cascading clears), now we:
- Set `isInitializing = true`
- Load province AND its available districts
- Load district AND its available communes  
- Load commune AND its available villages
- Load village
- Set `isInitializing = false`

This loads everything in one go without triggering the cascade.

#### 3. Protected Cascade Effects
Added guards to prevent clearing during initialization:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isInitializing) return;  // Skip during initialization
  
  if (selectedProvince) {
    // ... update districts and clear others
  }
}, [selectedProvince, isInitializing]);
```

## How It Works Now

### Initialization Flow
```
1. Modal opens with initialAddress = { province: "06", district: "0603", commune: "060301", village: "06030101" }
2. isInitializing = true
3. Load province "06" (កំពង់ធំ)
4. Load available districts for province "06"
5. Load district "0603" (ស្ទឹងសែន)
6. Load available communes for district "0603"
7. Load commune "060301"
8. Load available villages for commune "060301"
9. Load village "06030101"
10. isInitializing = false
11. All dropdowns now show the correct selections! ✓
```

### User Interaction Flow
```
User changes province:
1. isInitializing = false (normal operation)
2. Province changes
3. useEffect triggers → clears district, commune, village (expected behavior)
4. Loads new districts for selected province
5. User can now select from new districts
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Create New Application**:
- Select address → Close modal → Reopen → Selections are preserved

✅ **Edit Existing Application**:
- Open application with address → Click address field → Previous address is loaded

✅ **Change Selection**:
- Change province → District/commune/village reset (correct)
- Select new values → Close → Reopen → New values preserved

## Visual Confirmation

Before Fix:
```
Modal Preview: "ភូមិ X, ឃុំ Y, ស្រុក Z, កំពង់ធំ"
Dropdowns: [Empty] [Empty] [Empty] [Empty]
```

After Fix:
```
Modal Preview: "ភូមិ X, ឃុំ Y, ស្ទឹងសែន, កំពង់ធំ"
Dropdowns: [កំពង់ធំ] [ស្ទឹងសែន] [ឃុំ Y] [ភូមិ X]
```

## Key Insight

The issue wasn't about storage (cookies/localStorage) - it was about **React's effect execution order**. When you set multiple related states, each change can trigger effects that modify other states. The solution is to batch the initialization and prevent intermediate effects from running.

## No External Storage Needed

This solution uses pure React state management:
- ✓ No cookies
- ✓ No localStorage  
- ✓ No arrays or caching
- ✓ Just proper effect coordination

The data flow is:
```
Form State → initialAddress prop → AddressPicker initialization → Dropdown selections
```

All in React's memory, all reactive, all efficient!
