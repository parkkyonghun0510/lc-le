## Icon Used

**Icon:** `UserGroupIcon` from Heroicons
- **Style:** Outline (24px)
- **Represents:** Multiple people/employees
- **Color:** Inherits from navigation theme

**Why UserGroupIcon?**
- Distinct from `UsersIcon` (used for system users in admin section)
- Visually represents a group of employees
- Consistent with Heroicons design system

---

## Access Control

**Permissions:** 
- ✅ Available to ALL authenticated users
- ✅ No role restrictions (not in `adminNavigation` array)
- ✅ Visible to: admin, manager, officer roles

**Rationale:**
- Employees are a core feature used by all roles
- Officers need to assign employees to applications
- Managers need to view employee workload
- Admins need full employee management access
