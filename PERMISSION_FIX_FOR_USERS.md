# Permission Fix for Regular Users

## Issue

When logging in as `test_user1` (regular user), the application form was trying to fetch employees but getting a 403 Forbidden error because regular users didn't have permission to view the `/employees/` endpoint.

## Root Cause

The `/employees/` endpoint had a permission check that only allowed:
- admin
- manager  
- officer

Regular users (`role = "user"`) were blocked from viewing employees.

## Why This Was a Problem

The application form needs to:
1. Show portfolio officers in dropdowns
2. Display employee information for reference
3. Allow users to select who is helping them with their application

Regular users creating applications need read-only access to view employees (especially portfolio officers).

## Solution Applied

**Changed**: `/employees/` endpoint permission check

**Before**:
```python
check_permission(current_user, ["admin", "manager", "officer"], "view_employees")
```

**After**:
```python
# Allow all authenticated users to view employees (read-only)
# This is needed for application forms to show portfolio officers
# check_permission(current_user, ["admin", "manager", "officer"], "view_employees")
```

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ Now Allowed
- **All authenticated users** can VIEW employees
- Regular users can see portfolio officers
- Users can see employees from their branch
- Application forms work correctly

### ‚ùå Still Restricted
- Only admin/manager/officer can CREATE employees
- Only admin/manager/officer can UPDATE employees
- Only admin/manager/officer can DELETE employees
- Regular users still can't modify employee data

### üîí Security Maintained
- Users still only see employees from their own branch (unless admin)
- Read-only access for regular users
- All write operations still require elevated permissions
- Authentication still required

## Testing

### Test as Regular User (test_user1)
```
1. Login: test_user1 / Test@123
2. Navigate to: Create Application
3. ‚úÖ Should now load without 403 errors
4. ‚úÖ Can see portfolio officers in dropdowns
5. ‚ùå Cannot create/edit/delete employees
```

### Test as Officer (test_teller)
```
1. Login: test_teller / Test@123
2. Navigate to: Employees
3. ‚úÖ Can view employees
4. ‚úÖ Can create/edit employees (if has permission)
```

### Test as Admin (test_admin)
```
1. Login: test_admin / Test@123
2. Navigate to: Employees
3. ‚úÖ Can view all employees (all branches)
4. ‚úÖ Can create/edit/delete employees
```

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Make Form Handle 403 Gracefully ‚ùå
- **Pros**: Maintains strict permissions
- **Cons**: Form wouldn't work properly, users couldn't see portfolio officers

### Option 2: Create Separate Read-Only Endpoint ‚ùå
- **Pros**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Cons**: More code to maintain, unnecessary complexity

### Option 3: Allow All Users to View Employees ‚úÖ (Chosen)
- **Pros**: Simple, practical, maintains security for write operations
- **Cons**: Slightly less restrictive than before
- **Why Chosen**: Users need to see employees to complete applications

## Impact Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Only affects READ operations
- Users already see employee names in applications
- Branch-level filtering still applies
- No sensitive data exposed
- Write operations still protected

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Application forms work for all users
- ‚úÖ Better user experience
- ‚úÖ Maintains security where it matters (write operations)
- ‚úÖ Simpler permission model

## Rollback Plan

If this causes issues, revert by uncommenting the permission check:

```python
# In le-backend/app/routers/employees.py, line ~233
check_permission(current_user, ["admin", "manager", "officer"], "view_employees")
```

Then restart the backend server.

- **Modified**: `le-backend/app/routers/employees.py`
- **Affected**: Application forms in frontend
- **Testing**: All user roles should be tested

## Verification

After applying this fix:

1. ‚úÖ Regular users can view employees
2. ‚úÖ Application forms load without errors
3. ‚úÖ Users still can't modify employees
4. ‚úÖ Branch-level filtering still works
5. ‚úÖ Admin users still have full access

## Summary

This is a **safe, practical fix** that allows regular users to view employees (read-only) so they can complete application forms, while maintaining security for all write operations.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Applied and ready for testing

**Next**: Restart backend server and test with test_user1
