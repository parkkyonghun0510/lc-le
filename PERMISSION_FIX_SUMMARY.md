# Workflow Permission Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The manager review permission check was incorrect:
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (WRONG)
const canManagerReview = (userRole === 'manager' || userRole === 'admin') 
                         && workflowStatus === 'TELLER_PROCESSING';
```

This was checking for `TELLER_PROCESSING` status, but managers should review applications in `MANAGER_REVIEW` status (which is the status AFTER teller processing).

## Fix Applied
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (CORRECT)
const canManagerReview = (userRole === 'manager' || userRole === 'admin') 
                         && workflowStatus === 'MANAGER_REVIEW';
```

## Workflow Status Flow
```
Draft
  ↓ [User Submit]
USER_COMPLETED
  ↓ [Teller Process]
MANAGER_REVIEW  ← Managers review at THIS status
  ↓ [Manager Approve/Reject]
APPROVED / REJECTED
```

## Complete Permission Rules

### User (Application Owner)
- ✅ Can submit when `status === 'draft'` AND `userId === applicationUserId`
- ❌ Cannot perform teller or manager actions

### Officer (Teller)
- ✅ Can process when `userRole === 'officer'` AND `workflowStatus === 'USER_COMPLETED'`
- ❌ Cannot submit (user only) or approve/reject (manager only)

### Manager / Admin
- ✅ Can approve/reject when `userRole === 'manager' || 'admin'` AND `workflowStatus === 'MANAGER_REVIEW'`
- ❌ Cannot submit (user only) or process (officer only)

## Files Modified
1. `lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/applications/WorkflowActions.tsx` - Fixed permission check
2. `WORKFLOW_PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md` - Comprehensive permission documentation
3. `PERMISSION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test as officer: Should see Process button when status is USER_COMPLETED
- [ ] Test as manager: Should see Approve/Reject when status is MANAGER_REVIEW
- [ ] Test as manager: Should NOT see Approve/Reject when status is USER_COMPLETED
- [ ] Test as officer: Should NOT see Approve/Reject buttons
- [ ] Test as user: Should only see Submit button on own draft applications

## Impact
- ✅ Managers can now properly review applications
- ✅ Officers are restricted to teller processing only
- ✅ Clear separation of responsibilities
- ✅ Improved security and workflow integrity
