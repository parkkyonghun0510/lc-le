## Business Value

### Security Improvements

1. **Fine-Grained Access Control**
   - Permissions can be scoped to OWN, DEPARTMENT, BRANCH, or GLOBAL
   - More precise control over user capabilities
   - Reduced risk of unauthorized access

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Complete history of permission changes
   - User action tracking with timestamps
   - Compliance and security review capabilities

3. **Role Flexibility**
   - Custom roles with specific permission sets
   - Permission templates for common scenarios
   - Easy role management through admin UI

### Developer Experience

1. **Simplified Permission Checks**
   ```typescript
   // Old way (deprecated)
   if (user?.role === 'admin' || user?.role === 'manager') { ... }
   
   // New way (recommended)
   const { can } = usePermissionCheck();
   if (can('application', 'approve', 'department')) { ... }
   ```

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript interfaces for all permission types
   - Compile-time checking of permission names
   - Better IDE autocomplete support

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Clear migration guides
   - Code examples for common patterns
   - Troubleshooting guides

### Operational Benefits

1. **Admin UI**
   - No code changes needed to modify permissions
   - Visual permission matrix for easy understanding
   - Bulk operations for efficiency

2. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new permissions
   - Role templates for quick setup
   - Performance optimized for large datasets

3. **Maintainability**
   - Centralized permission logic
   - Consistent patterns across codebase
   - Reduced technical debt
