```

#### Railway Deployment Steps:

1. **Connect Repository to Railway**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Initialize project
   railway init
   ```

2. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click "Add Service" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Copy the DATABASE_URL from the database service

3. **Configure Backend Service**
   - Add a new service from your GitHub repository
   - Set root directory to `backend/le-backend`
   - Add all environment variables listed above
   - Set start command: `alembic upgrade head && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

4. **Deploy Backend**
   - Railway will automatically deploy on git push
   - Monitor logs for any deployment issues
   - Verify health endpoint: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`

## Frontend Deployment (Next.js)

### 1. Prepare Frontend for Production

#### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=LC Workflow
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

#### Railway Deployment Steps:

1. **Configure Frontend Service**
   - Add a new service from your GitHub repository
   - Set root directory to `backend/lc-workflow-frontend`
   - Add environment variables listed above
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`

2. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Railway will automatically deploy on git push
   - Verify deployment at your Railway-provided URL

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend Verification
1. **Health Check**: `GET https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`
2. **API Documentation**: `GET https://your-backend-url.railway.app/docs`
3. **Database Connection**: Check logs for successful database connection
4. **File Upload**: Test file upload functionality

### Frontend Verification
1. **Application Load**: Verify the application loads correctly
2. **API Integration**: Test login and data fetching
3. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
4. **Responsive Design**: Test on different devices

### Integration Testing
1. **User Registration/Login**: Test complete auth flow
2. **Application Creation**: Test multi-step form submission
3. **File Upload**: Test document attachment functionality
4. **Data Persistence**: Verify data is saved correctly

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging
- Backend logs are available in Railway dashboard
- Frontend logs are available in Railway dashboard
- Set up log aggregation if needed

### Database Maintenance
- Regular backups are handled by Railway PostgreSQL
- Monitor database performance and storage usage
- Plan for scaling as data grows

### Security
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Rotate secrets periodically
- Review CORS settings

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor response times
- Track error rates
- Monitor resource usage
- Set up alerts for critical issues

## Scaling Considerations

### Backend Scaling
- Increase worker count for higher traffic
- Consider horizontal scaling with multiple instances
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries

### Frontend Scaling
- Railway automatically handles CDN distribution
- Consider implementing service worker for offline functionality
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance

## Rollback Procedure

### In Case of Issues
1. **Railway Dashboard**: Use the rollback feature to previous deployment
2. **Git Revert**: Revert problematic commits and redeploy
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify all environment variables are correct
4. **Database**: Check if database migrations need to be reverted

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CORS Errors**: Verify CORS_ORIGINS includes your frontend domain
2. **Database Connection**: Check DATABASE_URL format and credentials
3. **File Upload Issues**: Verify MinIO configuration and permissions
4. **Authentication Issues**: Check SECRET_KEY and token expiration settings

- Check Railway documentation
- Review application logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test locally with production environment variables
