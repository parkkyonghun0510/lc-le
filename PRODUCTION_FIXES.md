# Production Deployment Fixes

## Issue Summary
- **Mixed Content Errors**: Frontend using HTTP instead of HTTPS for backend API calls
- **401 Authentication Errors**: Improper handling of authentication tokens and CORS

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Frontend API client was not consistently enforcing HTTPS in production
2. Authentication token cleanup was not properly handled on 401 responses
3. WebSocket URL had incorrect formatting with double slashes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced HTTPS Enforcement
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Added automatic HTTPS upgrade for production environments
- Added Railway-specific environment detection
- Improved URL normalization to prevent mixed content

### 2. Improved Authentication Flow
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Enhanced 401 error handling with proper token cleanup
- Added detailed error logging for debugging
- Improved redirect flow with error messages
- Added specific handling for mixed content errors

### 3. Environment Configuration
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/.env.production`
- Fixed WebSocket URL formatting (removed double slash)
- Ensured all URLs use HTTPS/WSS protocols
- Added production-specific environment variables

## Deployment Steps

### Railway Frontend Configuration
1. **Environment Variables** (Railway Dashboard → Variables):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://backend-production-478f.up.railway.app/api/v1/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://backend-production-478f.up.railway.app/api/ws/
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Redeploy Frontend**:
   - Push changes to trigger automatic Railway deployment
   - Or manually trigger redeployment in Railway dashboard

### Verification Steps
1. **Check HTTPS Enforcement**:
   - Open browser dev tools → Network tab
   - Verify all API calls use HTTPS
   - Confirm no mixed content warnings

2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Log out and log back in
   - Navigate to protected routes
   - Verify 401 errors are handled gracefully

3. **Test Real-time Features**:
   - Check WebSocket connections use WSS
   - Verify real-time updates work correctly

## Monitoring
- Monitor browser console for any remaining HTTPS warnings
- Check Railway logs for any backend connection issues
- Verify CORS headers are properly configured

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check Railway environment variables are set correctly
3. Verify backend CORS configuration includes frontend URL
4. Check browser network tab for specific error details
