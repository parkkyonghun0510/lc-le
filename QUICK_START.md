# Quick Start - Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Fixed
The frontend was getting a 404 error when calling `/api/v1/auth/me/permissions` because the endpoint didn't exist in the backend.

## What Changed
Added the missing endpoint to `le-backend/app/routers/auth.py` that returns:
- User's roles
- Direct permissions
- Effective permissions (combined)

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Restart Your Backend Server

**If running in terminal:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
cd le-backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8090
```

**If running as a service/Docker:**
```bash
# Restart your container or service
docker-compose restart backend
# or
systemctl restart your-backend-service
```

### 2. Verify It Works

Open your frontend application and check:
- ✅ No more 404 errors in browser console
- ✅ Permission checks work correctly
- ✅ User permissions load properly

### 3. Optional: Test the Endpoint

```bash
python test_me_permissions_endpoint.py
```

## That's It!

The fix is complete. Just restart your backend and the error will be gone.
