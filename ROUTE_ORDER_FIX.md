# Route Order Fix - 422 Error Resolution

## üêõ Problem
The notification endpoint was returning a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error:
```
GET /users/notifications?limit=20&offset=0&unread_only=false 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
```

**Error Details:**
```
'Input should be a valid UUID, invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `n` at 1', 'input': 'notifications'
```

## üîç Root Cause
The issue was **route order conflict** in FastAPI. Routes are matched in the order they are defined:

1. `/users/{user_id}` route was defined BEFORE `/users/notifications`
2. When requesting `/users/notifications`, FastAPI matched it to `/users/{user_id}` first
3. It tried to parse "notifications" as a UUID for the `user_id` parameter
4. This caused a validation error (422) because "notifications" is not a valid UUID

## ‚úÖ Solution
**Moved all notification routes BEFORE the `/{user_id}` routes** in the router definition.

### Before Fix (Incorrect Order):
```python
@router.get("/{user_id}")  # ‚Üê This matches first
async def get_user(user_id: UUID, ...):
    # ...

# ... other routes ...

@router.get("/notifications")  # ‚Üê This never gets reached
async def get_user_notifications(...):
    # ...
```

### After Fix (Correct Order):
```python
# Notification routes FIRST
@router.get("/notifications/preferences")
async def get_notification_preferences(...):
    # ...

@router.get("/notifications")
async def get_user_notifications(...):
    # ...

# ... other notification routes ...

# User-specific routes AFTER
@router.get("/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: UUID, ...):
    # ...
```

## üìÅ Files Modified
- `le-backend/app/routers/users.py` - Reordered routes and removed duplicates

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Moved Notification Routes
Moved all notification routes to be defined BEFORE the `/{user_id}` routes:
- `GET /notifications/preferences`
- `PUT /notifications/preferences`
- `POST /notifications/test`
- `POST /notifications/onboarding-reminders`
- `GET /notifications/summary`
- `GET /notifications` ‚Üê **This was the problematic route**
- `PUT /notifications/{notification_id}/read`
- `PUT /notifications/{notification_id}/dismiss`
- `PUT /notifications/mark-all-read`

### 2. Removed Duplicate Routes
Removed duplicate notification route definitions that were defined later in the file.

### 3. Preserved User-Specific Routes
Kept user-specific notification routes (like `POST /{user_id}/notifications/welcome`) AFTER the `/{user_id}` routes since they require a user_id parameter.

## üéØ Expected Result
- ‚úÖ `/users/notifications` now matches the correct route
- ‚úÖ No more 422 validation errors
- ‚úÖ Notification system works correctly
- ‚úÖ All notification management features functional

## üß™ Testing
The fix can be verified by:
1. Starting the backend server
2. Making a request to `GET /users/notifications`
3. Confirming it returns 200 instead of 422
4. Verifying notifications are returned correctly

## üìö FastAPI Route Matching Rules
This fix follows FastAPI's route matching principles:
1. **Order Matters**: Routes are matched in definition order
2. **Specific Before Generic**: Specific routes should come before parameterized routes
3. **Path Parameters**: Routes with path parameters (like `/{user_id}`) should come last

## üöÄ Additional Benefits
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed duplicate route definitions
- **Better Organization**: Related routes grouped together
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand route structure
- **Performance**: Slightly faster route matching

## ‚úÖ Status: RESOLVED

The 422 error has been fixed by correcting the route order. The notification system should now work correctly without any validation errors.
