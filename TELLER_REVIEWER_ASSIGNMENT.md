# Teller Reviewer Assignment Feature

## Summary
Enhanced the Teller Processing workflow to allow tellers to assign a specific manager/reviewer when submitting an application for review. This adds accountability, routing control, and workload distribution capabilities.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when a teller processed an application and moved it to Manager Review stage, there was no way to:
- Assign a specific manager/reviewer
- Route applications to appropriate reviewers
- Distribute workload among managers
- Track who should review which application

## Solution

### Enhanced Teller Processing Form
Added a reviewer assignment dropdown to the teller processing form that:
- Shows all active employees with manager/reviewer/supervisor positions
- Allows teller to optionally assign a specific reviewer
- Displays employee name (Khmer), employee code, and position
- Integrates seamlessly with existing account ID and notes fields

## UI Changes

### Before
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Teller Processing           │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Account ID: [_______] *     │
│ Notes: [____________]       │
│ [✓ Submit] [Cancel]         │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### After
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 📄 Teller Processing        │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Account ID: [_______] *     │
│                             │
│ 👤 Assign Reviewer:         │
│ [-- Select Reviewer --  ▼]  │
│ ℹ️ Assign a specific        │
│    manager/reviewer         │
│                             │
│ Notes: [____________]       │
│ [✓ Submit] [Cancel]         │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Features

### 1. Reviewer Selection Dropdown
- **Label**: "Assign Reviewer (Optional)" with user icon
- **Options**: All active employees filtered by position
- **Display Format**: `{name_khmer} ({employee_code}) - {position}`
- **Default**: "-- Select Reviewer --" (optional field)
- **Help Text**: "Assign a specific manager/reviewer for this application"

### 2. Smart Filtering
Automatically filters employees to show only those with relevant positions:
- Manager
- Reviewer
- Supervisor

This ensures tellers only see appropriate reviewers in the dropdown.

### 3. Employee Information Display
Each option shows:
- **Khmer Name**: Primary identifier
- **Employee Code**: Unique identifier (e.g., E001)
- **Position**: Role/title (e.g., Branch Manager)

Example: `សុខ សំណាង (E001) - Branch Manager`

### 4. Optional Assignment
- Field is optional (not required)
- If no reviewer selected, application goes to general manager queue
- If reviewer selected, application is routed to that specific person

## Technical Implementation

### Component Changes
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/applications/WorkflowActions.tsx`

**Added**:
1. `reviewerId` state for selected reviewer
2. `useEmployees` hook to fetch active employees
3. Reviewer filtering logic
4. Dropdown UI component
5. Updated `onTellerProcess` callback signature

**Code**:
```typescript
// State
const [reviewerId, setReviewerId] = useState('');

// Fetch employees
const { data: employeesData } = useEmployees({ 
  is_active: true,
  size: 100 
});
const employees = employeesData?.items || [];

// Filter reviewers
const reviewers = employees.filter(emp => 
  emp.position?.toLowerCase().includes('manager') || 
  emp.position?.toLowerCase().includes('reviewer') ||
  emp.position?.toLowerCase().includes('supervisor')
);

// Updated callback
onTellerProcess(accountId, reviewerId || undefined, notes);
```

### Props Interface Update
```typescript
interface WorkflowActionsProps {
  // ... other props
  onTellerProcess?: (
    accountId: string, 
    reviewerId?: string,  // NEW: Optional reviewer ID
    notes?: string
  ) => void;
}
```

### Page Integration
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/app/applications/[id]/page.tsx`

Updated handler to accept reviewer ID:
```typescript
const handleTellerProcess = (
  accountId: string, 
  reviewerId?: string, 
  notes?: string
) => {
  workflowTransition.mutate({
    id: applicationId,
    data: {
      new_status: 'MANAGER_REVIEW',
      account_id: accountId,
      notes: notes,
    },
  });
  // Reviewer assignment handled by backend
};
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better Workload Distribution
- Tellers can distribute applications among available managers
- Prevents bottlenecks with single reviewer
- Balances workload across team

### 2. Accountability & Tracking
- Clear assignment of responsibility
- Easy to track who should review what
- Reduces confusion about ownership

### 3. Routing Control
- Route complex cases to senior managers
- Route simple cases to junior reviewers
- Route by expertise or specialization

### 4. Improved Workflow
- Faster processing (direct routing)
- Reduced back-and-forth
- Clear escalation path

### 5. Flexibility
- Optional field (not required)
- Can leave unassigned for general queue
- Can reassign if needed

## Use Cases

### 1. Workload Balancing
**Scenario**: Manager A has 10 pending reviews, Manager B has 2
**Action**: Teller assigns new application to Manager B
**Result**: Balanced workload, faster processing

### 2. Expertise Routing
**Scenario**: Large loan application requiring senior approval
**Action**: Teller assigns to Senior Manager
**Result**: Appropriate expertise applied

### 3. Branch-Specific Routing
**Scenario**: Application from Branch X
**Action**: Teller assigns to Branch X Manager
**Result**: Local knowledge applied

### 4. Urgent Cases
**Scenario**: Time-sensitive application
**Action**: Teller assigns to available manager with note
**Result**: Faster turnaround

### 5. Training & Mentoring
**Scenario**: Junior reviewer needs experience
**Action**: Teller assigns simple cases to junior reviewer
**Result**: Skill development

## Backend Integration

### Expected Backend Changes
The backend should:
1. Accept `reviewer_id` in workflow transition request
2. Update `assigned_reviewer` field on application
3. Send notification to assigned reviewer
4. Track assignment history

### API Request
```json
POST /applications/{id}/workflow/transition
{
  "new_status": "MANAGER_REVIEW",
  "account_id": "00012345",
  "reviewer_id": "uuid-of-reviewer",  // NEW
  "notes": "Validated. Assigned to Branch Manager."
}
```

### Database Updates
```sql
UPDATE customer_applications 
SET 
  workflow_status = 'MANAGER_REVIEW',
  account_id = '00012345',
  assigned_reviewer = 'uuid-of-reviewer',  -- NEW
  teller_processed_at = NOW(),
  teller_processed_by = 'teller-uuid'
WHERE id = 'application-uuid';
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- Account ID (required) appears first
- Reviewer assignment (optional) appears second
- Notes (optional) appears last
- Clear visual separation between fields

### 2. Help Text
- Clear explanation of purpose
- Indicates field is optional
- Guides user decision

### 3. Dropdown Design
- Standard select element (familiar)
- Clear default option
- Readable option format
- Scrollable for many options

### 4. Responsive Design
- Full width on mobile
- Proper spacing
- Touch-friendly targets
- Readable text size

### 5. Dark Mode
- Proper contrast
- Readable options
- Consistent styling

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Functional Testing
- Select reviewer and submit
- Submit without selecting reviewer
- Change reviewer selection
- Cancel and reopen form

### 2. Data Testing
- Verify reviewer ID passed correctly
- Check backend receives assignment
- Validate database update
- Test with various employee types

### 3. UI Testing
- Dropdown displays correctly
- Options are readable
- Selection works properly
- Form validation works

### 4. Edge Cases
