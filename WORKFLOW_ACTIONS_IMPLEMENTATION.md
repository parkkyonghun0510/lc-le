# Workflow Actions Implementation

## Summary
Created a comprehensive workflow actions system that provides role-based UI for processing applications through different workflow stages: User Submit → Teller Processing → Manager Review → Final Decision (Approve/Reject).

## Problem Solved
Previously, the application detail page only had basic Submit/Approve/Reject buttons that didn't properly handle the full workflow stages (Teller Processing and Manager Review). There was no UI for:
- Teller to input account ID and move application to manager review
- Manager to review teller-processed applications
- Clear separation of workflow stages and permissions

## Solution

### 1. Created WorkflowActions Component
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/applications/WorkflowActions.tsx`

A reusable component (< 300 lines) that:
- Shows appropriate actions based on workflow status and user role
- Handles all workflow transitions
- Provides forms for data input (account ID for teller)
- Includes modals for rejection with reason

**Key Features**:
- **Role-based visibility**: Only shows actions user is authorized to perform
- **Workflow-aware**: Displays different UI based on current workflow status
- **Data validation**: Requires account ID for teller processing
- **User feedback**: Loading states and clear action labels
- **Bilingual**: Khmer and English labels

### 2. Updated Application Detail Page
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/app/applications/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added WorkflowActions component to sidebar
- Integrated with existing workflow hooks
- Removed redundant action buttons from header
- Added workflow transition handlers
- Moved all workflow actions to sidebar for better organization

## Workflow Stages & Actions

### Stage 1: Draft → User Completed
**Who**: Application owner (user who created it)
**Action**: Submit button
**UI**: Simple submit button
**Result**: Moves to USER_COMPLETED status

### Stage 2: User Completed → Teller Processing
**Who**: Teller (officer role)
**Action**: Process button with form
**UI**: 
- "Process" button opens inline form
- Form requires Account ID (required field)
- Optional notes field for validation comments
- Submit to Manager button
- Cancel button to close form
**Result**: Moves to MANAGER_REVIEW status with account ID validated

### Stage 3: Teller Processing → Manager Review
**Who**: Manager or Admin
**Action**: Approve or Reject buttons
**UI**:
- Green "Approve" button
- Red "Reject" button
- Reject opens modal requiring reason
**Result**: 
- Approve → APPROVED status
- Reject → REJECTED status with reason

## Component Structure

```typescript
<WorkflowActions
  applicationId={string}
  workflowStatus={string}          // Current workflow status
  status={string}                  // Application status
  userRole={string}                // Current user's role
  userId={string}                  // Current user's ID
  applicationUserId={string}       // Application owner's ID
  onSubmit={() => void}            // Handler for user submit
  onTellerProcess={(accountId, notes) => void}  // Handler for teller
  onManagerApprove={() => void}    // Handler for manager approve
  onManagerReject={(reason) => void}  // Handler for manager reject
  isLoading={boolean}              // Loading state
/>
```

## UI Components by Role

### User (Application Owner)
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ សកម្មភាព (Actions)          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ [📄 ដាក់ស្នើ (Submit)]      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Teller (Officer)
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ សកម្មភាព (Actions)          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ [→ ដំណើរការ (Process)]      │
│                             │
│ When clicked:               │
│ ┌─────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Teller Processing       │ │
│ │ Account ID: [_______]   │ │
│ │ Notes: [____________]   │ │
│ │ [✓ Submit] [Cancel]     │ │
│ └─────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Manager/Admin
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ សកម្មភាព (Actions)          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ [✓ អនុម័ត (Approve)]        │
│ [✗ បដិសេធ (Reject)]         │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Permission Logic

```typescript
// User can submit if they own the application and it's in draft
canSubmit = userId === applicationUserId && status === 'draft'

// Teller can process if they're an officer and status is USER_COMPLETED
canTellerProcess = userRole === 'officer' && workflowStatus === 'USER_COMPLETED'

// Manager can review if they're manager/admin and status is TELLER_PROCESSING
canManagerReview = (userRole === 'manager' || userRole === 'admin') 
                   && workflowStatus === 'TELLER_PROCESSING'
```

## Integration with Backend

### Workflow Transition API
```typescript
POST /applications/{id}/workflow/transition
{
  "new_status": "MANAGER_REVIEW",
  "account_id": "00012345",  // Required for teller → manager
  "notes": "Account validated"
}
```

### Approval API
```typescript
POST /applications/{id}/approve
{
  "approved_amount": 5000000,
  "approved_term": 12,
  "interest_rate": 2.5
}
```

### Rejection API
```typescript
POST /applications/{id}/reject
{
  "reason": "Insufficient documentation"
}
```

## Visual Design

### Teller Processing Form
- **Background**: Light blue (blue-50/blue-900)
- **Border**: Blue (blue-200/blue-700)
- **Fields**: White input with focus ring
- **Buttons**: Primary (submit) + Secondary (cancel)

### Manager Actions
- **Approve Button**: Green with checkmark icon
- **Reject Button**: Red with X icon
- **Full width**: Easy to click on mobile

### Reject Modal
- **Backdrop**: Black with blur
- **Modal**: White/dark with shadow
- **Icon**: Red circle with X
- **Required field**: Rejection reason textarea
- **Buttons**: Cancel (secondary) + Reject (error)

## Benefits

### 1. Clear Workflow Progression
- Users see exactly what actions they can take
- No confusion about workflow stages
- Visual feedback on current stage (timeline + actions)

### 2. Role-Based Security
- Only authorized users see relevant actions
- Prevents unauthorized workflow transitions
- Clear permission boundaries

### 3. Data Validation
- Account ID required for teller processing
- Rejection reason required for rejections
- Form validation before submission

### 4. Better UX
- Actions grouped in sidebar (not scattered)
- Inline forms (no page navigation)
- Loading states during processing
- Clear success/error feedback

### 5. Code Organization
- Separate component (< 300 lines)
- Reusable across pages
- Easy to test and maintain
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Permission Testing
- Test as user (should only see submit)
- Test as teller (should see process form)
- Test as manager (should see approve/reject)
- Test as admin (should see manager actions)

### 2. Workflow State Testing
- Draft status → Submit button
- USER_COMPLETED → Teller process
- TELLER_PROCESSING → Manager review
- APPROVED/REJECTED → No actions

### 3. Form Validation
- Teller form without account ID (should disable submit)
- Reject without reason (should disable reject)
- Valid inputs (should submit successfully)

### 4. UI/UX Testing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Dark mode compatibility
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Modal interactions

### 5. Integration Testing
- Submit application
- Process as teller with account ID
- Approve as manager
- Reject as manager with reason

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive workflow actions system that:
- Provides clear UI for each workflow stage
- Enforces role-based permissions
- Handles all workflow transitions (Submit → Teller → Manager → Decision)
- Includes data validation (account ID, rejection reason)
- Organizes all actions in sidebar for better UX
- Maintains code quality with separate, reusable component

The system now properly supports the full workflow: User Submit → Teller Processing (with account ID) → Manager Review → Final Decision (Approve/Reject).
