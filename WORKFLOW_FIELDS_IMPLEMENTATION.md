Added a new dedicated section displaying:

1. **Workflow Status** - Current workflow status (e.g., PO_CREATED, USER_COMPLETED)
2. **Workflow Stage** - Current stage in the workflow
3. **Assigned Reviewer** - UUID of the assigned reviewer
4. **Priority Level** - Priority level with color coding (high=red, urgent=orange, normal=blue, low=gray)
5. **Created At** - Application creation timestamp

2. **Marital Status** - Marital status with Khmer translations (នៅលីវ/រៀបការ/លែងលះ/មេម៉ាយ/បែកគ្នា)
3. **Account ID** - Account identifier with validation status badge
4. **Account ID Validation Notes** - Notes about account validation (if present)

## Technical Changes

### 1. Frontend Type Updates
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/types/models.ts`

Added missing fields to `CustomerApplication` interface:
```typescript
// Workflow Tracking fields
workflow_stage?: string;
assigned_reviewer?: string;
priority_level?: string;
po_created_at?: string;
po_created_by?: string;
user_completed_at?: string;
user_completed_by?: string;
teller_processed_at?: string;
teller_processed_by?: string;
manager_reviewed_at?: string;
manager_reviewed_by?: string;

// Account validation
account_id_validated?: boolean;
account_id_validation_notes?: string;
```

### 2. UI Implementation
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/app/applications/[id]/page.tsx`

Added two new Card sections:
- **Workflow Tracking Card** - Displays all workflow-related timestamps and status
- **Demographics & Account Card** - Displays sex, marital status, and account information

## UI Features

### Visual Enhancements
- ✅ Color-coded priority levels (high, urgent, normal, low)
- ✅ Validation status badges for Account ID (green for validated, red for not validated)
- ✅ Khmer translations for all labels and values
- ✅ Consistent card styling with hover effects
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (2 columns on large screens, 1 column on mobile)
- ✅ Icon-based visual hierarchy

### Data Display
- All timestamps formatted using the `formatDate()` utility
- Fallback to 'មិនបានបញ្ជាក់' (Not specified) for missing values
- Proper handling of optional fields

## Field Coverage Update

### Before Implementation
- Showing: ~20 fields (40%)
- Missing: ~30 fields (60%)

### After Implementation
- Showing: ~33 fields (66%)
- Missing: ~17 fields (34%)

### Remaining Missing Fields (Skipped as requested)
The following 7 fields were intentionally skipped:
1. Occupation
2. Employer Name
3. Monthly Income
4. Income Source
5. Monthly Expenses
6. Assets Value
7. Existing Loans

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Data Display**
   - Check that all workflow timestamps display correctly
   - Verify priority level color coding works
   - Test account validation badge display

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Applications with missing workflow fields
   - Applications without account_id
   - Different priority levels (high, urgent, normal, low)

3. **Responsive Testing**
   - Verify layout on mobile devices
   - Check card stacking on smaller screens

4. **Dark Mode**
   - Verify all colors work in dark mode
   - Check badge visibility in dark mode

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add the remaining 7 employment/financial fields later:
1. Add fields to backend schema (if not already present)
2. Update `CustomerApplication` interface
3. Create a new "Employment & Financial Information" section
4. Add appropriate icons and styling

## Files Modified

1. `lc-workflow-frontend/src/types/models.ts` - Added missing type definitions
2. `lc-workflow-frontend/app/applications/[id]/page.tsx` - Added UI sections
3. `WORKFLOW_FIELDS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Validation

✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ No diagnostic errors
✅ All fields properly typed
✅ Consistent with existing UI patterns
