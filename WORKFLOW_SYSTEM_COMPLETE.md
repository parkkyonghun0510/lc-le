# Workflow System - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of a role-based workflow system for loan application processing with visual timeline, action controls, and permission enforcement.

## System Architecture

### Workflow Stages
```
1. Draft (PO_CREATED)
   ↓ User Submit
2. User Completed (USER_COMPLETED)
   ↓ Teller Process + Account ID + Assign Reviewer
3. Manager Review (MANAGER_REVIEW)
   ↓ Manager Approve/Reject
4. Final Decision (APPROVED / REJECTED)
```

## Components Implemented

### 1. WorkflowTimeline Component ✅
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/applications/WorkflowTimeline.tsx`
**Location**: Right sidebar
**Size**: ~250 lines

**Features**:
- Visual vertical timeline with connecting line
- Step icons (✅ completed, ⏰ current, ⭕ pending, ❌ rejected)
- Color-coded priority badge (high/urgent/normal/low)
- Current workflow status display
- Assigned reviewer display
- Timestamps for completed steps
- Visual legend
- Bilingual labels (Khmer + English)

**Benefits**:
- Compact design (saves ~200px vertical space)
- Easy to understand at a glance
- Clear visual progression
- Animated current step (pulsing clock)

---

### 2. WorkflowActions Component ✅
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/applications/WorkflowActions.tsx`
**Location**: Right sidebar (below timeline)
**Size**: ~350 lines

**Features**:
- Role-based action visibility
- User Submit button
- Teller Processing form with:
  - Account ID input (required)
  - Reviewer assignment dropdown (optional)
  - Notes textarea (optional)
- Manager Approve/Reject buttons
- Reject modal with reason input
- Loading states

- Prevents unauthorized actions
- Inline forms (no page navigation)
- Data validation before submission

---

### 3. Application Detail Page Updates ✅
**File**: `lc-workflow-frontend/app/applications/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed large workflow tracking card from main content
- Added WorkflowTimeline to sidebar
- Added WorkflowActions to sidebar

## Permission Matrix (Enforced)

| Role | Submit | Process (Teller) | Approve/Reject |
|------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **User (Owner)** | ✅ Draft only | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Officer (Teller)** | ❌ | ✅ USER_COMPLETED only | ❌ |
| **Manager** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ MANAGER_REVIEW only |
| **Admin** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ MANAGER_REVIEW only |

### Permission Logic
```typescript
// User can submit their own draft applications
canSubmit = userId === applicationUserId && status === 'draft'

// Officers can process applications in USER_COMPLETED status
canTellerProcess = userRole === 'officer' && workflowStatus === 'USER_COMPLETED'

// Managers/Admins can review applications in MANAGER_REVIEW status
canManagerReview = (userRole === 'manager' || userRole === 'admin') 
                   && workflowStatus === 'MANAGER_REVIEW'
```

## Workflow Actions Detail

### Action 1: User Submit
**Who**: Application owner
**When**: Status is 'draft'
**UI**: Simple submit button
**Data Required**: None
**Result**: Draft → USER_COMPLETED

---

### Action 2: Teller Process
**Who**: Officer (Teller)
**When**: Workflow status is 'USER_COMPLETED'
**UI**: Process button → Inline form
**Data Required**:
- ✅ Account ID (required)
- ⭕ Reviewer Assignment (optional)
- ⭕ Notes (optional)

**Form Fields**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📄 Teller Processing            │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Account ID: [00012345    ] *    │
│                                 │
│ 👤 Assign Reviewer:             │
│ [សុខ សំណាង (E001) - Manager ▼] │
│ ℹ️ Assign a specific manager    │
│                                 │
│ Notes: [Validated successfully] │
│                                 │
│ [✓ Submit to Manager] [Cancel]  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result**: USER_COMPLETED → MANAGER_REVIEW
**Backend Updates**:
- Sets account_id
- Sets account_id_validated = true
- Sets assigned_reviewer (if provided)
- Sets teller_processed_at timestamp
- Sets teller_processed_by user ID

---

### Action 3: Manager Approve
**Who**: Manager or Admin
**When**: Workflow status is 'MANAGER_REVIEW'
**UI**: Green approve button
**Data Required**: None (uses application data)
**Result**: MANAGER_REVIEW → APPROVED
**Backend Updates**:
- Sets approved_at timestamp
- Sets approved_by user ID
- Sets manager_reviewed_at timestamp

---

### Action 4: Manager Reject
**Who**: Manager or Admin
**When**: Workflow status is 'MANAGER_REVIEW'
**UI**: Red reject button → Modal
**Data Required**:
- ✅ Rejection reason (required)

**Modal**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ❌ បដិសេធពាក្យសុំ                │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ មូលហេតុបដិសេធ *                 │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Insufficient documentation  │ │
│ │                             │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                 │
│        [បោះបង់] [បដិសេធ]        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result**: MANAGER_REVIEW → REJECTED
**Backend Updates**:
- Sets rejected_at timestamp
- Sets rejected_by user ID
- Sets rejection_reason
- Sets manager_reviewed_at timestamp

}
```

### Approve Application
```typescript
