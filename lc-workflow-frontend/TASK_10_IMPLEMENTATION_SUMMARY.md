## Technical Implementation Details

### Hooks Used
1. **useWorkloadSummary** - Fetches workload summary for all employees
2. **useEmployeeWorkload** - Fetches workload data for specific employee
3. **useEmployeeAssignments** - Fetches all assignments for specific employee
4. **useEmployee** - Fetches employee details
5. **useDepartments** - Fetches departments for filter dropdown
6. **useBranches** - Fetches branches for filter dropdown
7. **useRole** - Checks user role for permission control

### Permission Control
- Both pages check if user is admin or manager
- Non-authorized users see "Access Denied" message
- Redirect option to employees list page

### Data Filtering
Both pages support filtering by:
- Department ID
- Branch ID
- Date range (from/to)
- Status (detail page only)

Filters are passed as query parameters to the API endpoints.

### UI Components
- **Layout** - Main layout wrapper
- **ProtectedRoute** - Authentication wrapper
- **LoadingSpinner** - Loading state indicator
- **Lucide Icons** - Icon library for UI elements

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Consistent color scheme:
  - Blue: Primary actions, metrics
  - Green: Success, completed
  - Yellow: Pending, warnings
  - Red: Errors, rejected
  - Purple: Secondary actions, special features
  - Gray: Neutral, inactive

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Tables scroll horizontally on small screens
- Filters stack vertically on mobile

## API Endpoints Used

### Workload Overview Page
- `GET /employees/reports/workload-summary` - Get workload summary for all employees
  - Query params: department_id, branch_id, date_from, date_to

### Employee Detail Page
- `GET /employees/{id}` - Get employee details
- `GET /employees/{id}/workload` - Get employee workload metrics
  - Query params: status, date_from, date_to
- `GET /employees/assignments/employee/{id}` - Get all assignments for employee

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Workload Overview Page:**
   - [ ] Access page as admin/manager
   - [ ] Verify permission check for non-admin/manager users
   - [ ] Test all filter combinations
   - [ ] Verify summary cards calculate correctly
   - [ ] Test "View Details" button navigation
   - [ ] Test responsive layout on mobile

2. **Employee Detail Page:**
   - [ ] Navigate from workload overview
   - [ ] Verify all employee info displays correctly
   - [ ] Test metrics cards
   - [ ] Test status breakdown
   - [ ] Test assignment filters
   - [ ] Click application ID link to verify navigation
   - [ ] Test back button
   - [ ] Test responsive layout on mobile

3. **Navigation:**
   - [ ] Verify "Workload Dashboard" button appears on employees page
   - [ ] Test navigation between pages

### Edge Cases to Test
- Empty workload data
- Employee with no assignments
- Invalid employee ID
- Network errors
- Loading states
- Very long employee names
- Many status types
- Large number of assignments
