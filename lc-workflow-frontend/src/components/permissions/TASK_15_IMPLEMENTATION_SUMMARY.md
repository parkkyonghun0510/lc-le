### 5. User-Friendly Error Messages

All error messages now include:
1. **Clear error title**: Brief description of what went wrong
2. **Context**: Explanation of why the error occurred
3. **Suggestions**: Actionable steps to resolve the issue
4. **Retry functionality**: Where appropriate, users can retry the operation
5. **Visual indicators**: Icons and color coding for error severity

#### Error Message Categories:

**403 Forbidden (Permission Denied)**
- Message: "Permission denied" or "Access denied"
- Context: Explains the specific action that was denied
- Suggestions:
  - Contact administrator for access
  - Verify correct account login
  - Check role permissions
  - Verify if system role/permission (cannot be modified)

**404 Not Found (Resource Not Found)**
- Message: "Resource not found" or "[Resource] not found"
- Context: Explains which resource is missing
- Suggestions:
  - Refresh the page to reload data
  - Resource may have been deleted by another user
  - Contact support if problem persists
- Includes retry button

**500 Server Error**
- Message: "Server error" or "Server error occurred"
- Context: Explains server encountered an error
- Suggestions:
  - Try again in a few moments
  - Refresh the page
  - Contact support if error continues
- Includes retry button

**Network Error**
- Message: "Network error" or "Network connection failed"
- Context: Unable to connect to server
- Suggestions:
  - Check internet connection
  - Try refreshing the page
  - Contact support if problem persists
- Includes retry button

**409 Conflict**
- Message: Context-specific (e.g., "Role already assigned", "Cannot delete role")
- Context: Explains the conflict
- Suggestions: Context-specific resolution steps

**422 Validation Error**
- Message: "Invalid data" or "Validation error"
- Context: Explains what data is invalid
- Suggestions:
  - Review all required fields
  - Check input format
  - Ensure values meet requirements

### 6. Retry Functionality

Implemented retry buttons for recoverable errors:
- Network errors
- Server errors (5xx)
- Resource not found errors
- All retry buttons trigger `refetch()` to reload data
- Retry functionality integrated with ErrorToast component

### 7. Loading States

All action buttons now show loading state:
- **Visual indicator**: Spinning animation replaces icon
- **Disabled state**: Button cannot be clicked during operation
- **Cursor feedback**: `cursor-not-allowed` when disabled
- **Opacity change**: `opacity-50` for disabled state
- **Title update**: Button title shows operation status

### 8. Integration with Existing Toast System

Leveraged existing `react-hot-toast` infrastructure:
- Used `toast.success()` for success messages
- Used `showErrorToast()` from `ErrorToast` component for errors
- Used `ErrorToasts` predefined error handlers where appropriate
- Consistent toast positioning (top-right)
- Appropriate durations (3s for success, 8s for errors)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios:

1. **Permission Matrix**
   - Toggle permissions with and without proper permissions
   - Test with network disconnected
   - Test with invalid role/permission IDs
   - Verify optimistic updates revert on failure

2. **Role Management**
   - Create role with duplicate name
   - Update system role (should fail)
   - Delete role that's in use
   - Test all operations with network issues

3. **User Permission Assignment**
   - Assign already-assigned role
   - Grant duplicate permission override
   - Revoke non-existent assignments
   - Test with insufficient permissions

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Verify retry buttons work correctly
   - Test error boundary catches React errors
   - Verify page remains functional after errors

5. **Loading States**
   - Verify buttons show loading state during operations
   - Confirm buttons are disabled during operations
   - Check that multiple rapid clicks don't cause issues

7. Add error rate monitoring and alerting

## Conclusion

Task 15 has been successfully completed with comprehensive error handling and user feedback enhancements across all permission management components. The implementation provides a robust, user-friendly experience with clear error messages, retry functionality, and proper loading states for all async operations.
