   ```typescript
   import { useOptimizedPermissions } from '@/hooks/useOptimizedPermissions';
   ```

2. **Add virtualization for large lists:**
   ```typescript
   import VirtualizedList from '@/components/permissions/VirtualizedList';
   ```

3. **Use responsive wrappers for mobile support:**
   ```typescript
   import ResponsivePermissionWrapper from '@/components/permissions/ResponsivePermissionWrapper';
   ```

4. **Add export functionality:**
   ```typescript
   import { exportToCSV } from '@/utils/exportUtils';
   ```
