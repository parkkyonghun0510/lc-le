# Employee Assignment System - Task 1 Implementation Summary

## Completed: Database Schema and Models Setup

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Database Migration
Created migration file: `le-backend/migrations/versions/20251015_add_employee_assignment_system.py`

**Tables Created:**
- `employees` - Stores employee information separate from system users
- `application_employee_assignments` - Links employees to applications with roles

**Columns Added:**
- `customer_applications.portfolio_officer_migrated` - Boolean flag to track migration status

#### 2. Database Schema Details

**employees table:**
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `employee_code` (VARCHAR(20), Unique, Not Null) - Unique identifier for each employee
- `full_name_khmer` (VARCHAR(255), Not Null)
- `full_name_latin` (VARCHAR(255), Not Null)
- `phone_number` (VARCHAR(20), Not Null)
- `email` (VARCHAR(255), Nullable)
- `position` (VARCHAR(100), Nullable)
- `department_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to departments)
- `branch_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to branches)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to users, Unique) - Optional link to system user
- `is_active` (Boolean, Default: true)
- `notes` (Text, Nullable)
- `created_at` (Timestamp with timezone)
- `updated_at` (Timestamp with timezone)
- `created_by` (UUID, Foreign Key to users)
- `updated_by` (UUID, Foreign Key to users)

**Indexes on employees:**
- `ix_employees_employee_code` (unique)
- `ix_employees_department_id`
- `ix_employees_branch_id`
- `ix_employees_is_active`
- `ix_employees_user_id`

**application_employee_assignments table:**
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `application_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to customer_applications, CASCADE on delete)
- `employee_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to employees, CASCADE on delete)
- `assignment_role` (VARCHAR(50), Not Null) - e.g., 'primary_officer', 'secondary_officer'
- `assigned_at` (Timestamp with timezone)
- `assigned_by` (UUID, Foreign Key to users)
- `is_active` (Boolean, Default: true)
- `notes` (Text, Nullable)

**Indexes on application_employee_assignments:**
- `ix_assignments_application_id`
- `ix_assignments_employee_id`
- `ix_assignments_assignment_role`
- `ix_assignments_is_active`
- `ix_unique_assignment` (unique composite index on application_id, employee_id, assignment_role)

**Foreign Key Constraints:**
- All foreign keys properly configured with appropriate ON DELETE actions
- CASCADE for assignment deletions when application/employee is deleted
- SET NULL for audit trail fields (created_by, updated_by, assigned_by)

#### 3. SQLAlchemy Models

**Added to `le-backend/app/models.py`:**

1. **Employee Model**
   - All fields matching database schema
   - Relationships:
     - `department` - Many-to-one with Department
     - `branch` - Many-to-one with Branch
     - `linked_user` - One-to-one with User (optional)
     - `creator` - Many-to-one with User (who created the employee)
     - `updater` - Many-to-one with User (who last updated)
     - `assignments` - One-to-many with ApplicationEmployeeAssignment

2. **ApplicationEmployeeAssignment Model**
   - All fields matching database schema
   - Relationships:
     - `application` - Many-to-one with CustomerApplication
     - `employee` - Many-to-one with Employee
     - `assigner` - Many-to-one with User (who made the assignment)
   - Unique constraint on (application_id, employee_id, assignment_role)

3. **CustomerApplication Model Updates**
   - Added `portfolio_officer_migrated` field (Boolean, default: False)
   - Added `employee_assignments` relationship (One-to-many with ApplicationEmployeeAssignment)

**Updated `le-backend/app/models/__init__.py`:**
- Exported `Employee` and `ApplicationEmployeeAssignment` models
- Added to `__all__` list for proper module imports

### Testing Performed

1. ✅ Database migration executed successfully
2. ✅ All tables created with correct schema
3. ✅ All indexes created for performance optimization
4. ✅ Foreign key constraints properly configured
5. ✅ Models can be imported and queried
6. ✅ Employee creation works with all relationships
7. ✅ Assignment creation works with proper linking
8. ✅ Cascade deletes work correctly
9. ✅ Unique constraints prevent duplicate assignments

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **Requirement 1.1**: Employee registry with all required fields
- ✅ **Requirement 1.2**: Employee code uniqueness enforced
- ✅ **Requirement 1.3**: Optional fields (email, position, department, branch)
- ✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Assignment table with employee_id reference
- ✅ **Requirement 2.5**: Multiple employees can be assigned with different roles

### Database Performance Optimizations

All necessary indexes created for:
- Fast employee lookups by code
- Efficient filtering by department, branch, and active status
- Quick assignment queries by application or employee
- Optimized role-based filtering
- Unique constraint enforcement without full table scans

### Migration Notes

- Migration revision: `add_employee_assignment_system`
- Depends on: `merge_soft_delete_and_existing`
- Merge migration created: `merge_employee_notification` to resolve multiple heads
- All migrations are reversible with proper downgrade functions

### Next Steps

The database schema and models are now ready for:
- Task 2: Backend Pydantic schemas
- Task 3: Employee service layer
- Task 4: Employee API endpoints
- Subsequent frontend implementation tasks
