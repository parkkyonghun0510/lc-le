# Task 11: Data Migration Utilities - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented data migration utilities to convert legacy `portfolio_officer_name` text fields to structured employee assignments. This includes both a backend migration script and an admin UI for managing the migration process.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. Migration Script (`le-backend/scripts/migrate_portfolio_officers.py`)
- **Purpose**: Automated script to migrate portfolio officer names to employee assignments
- **Features**:
  - Fuzzy matching using fuzzywuzzy library (80% similarity threshold)
  - Automatic employee creation for unmatched names
  - Sequential employee code generation (EMP-YYYY-NNNN format)
  - Dry-run mode for testing without committing changes
  - Comprehensive error handling and reporting
  - Detailed logging of all operations

- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  # Run migration
  python scripts/migrate_portfolio_officers.py
  
  # Dry run (no changes committed)
  python scripts/migrate_portfolio_officers.py --dry-run
  ```

- **Migration Process**:
  1. Finds all applications with `portfolio_officer_name` not migrated
  2. Attempts fuzzy match against existing employees (Khmer and Latin names)
  3. Creates new employee if no match found (with auto-generated code)
  4. Creates employee assignment with role "primary_officer"
  5. Marks application as migrated
  6. Generates detailed report

- **Report Structure**:
  ```python
  {
    'total': int,        # Total applications processed
    'matched': int,      # Matched to existing employees
    'created': int,      # New employees created
    'failed': int,       # Failed migrations
    'errors': List[str]  # Error messages
  }
  ```

#### 2. Admin API Router (`le-backend/app/routers/admin.py`)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/migration-status` - Get migration statistics
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/migrate-employees` - Start migration process
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/unmatched-names` - Get unmatched portfolio officer names
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/manual-match` - Manually match application to employee
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/revert-migration` - Revert migration (deactivate assignments)

- **Security**: All endpoints require admin role verification

- **Migration Status Response**:
  ```typescript
  {
    total_applications: number;
    migrated_applications: number;
    pending_applications: number;
    total_employees: number;
    active_employees: number;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Dependencies Added
- `fuzzywuzzy>=0.18.0` - Fuzzy string matching
- `python-Levenshtein>=0.21.0` - Fast string comparison (optional speedup)

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Migration UI Page (`lc-workflow-frontend/app/admin/migrate-employees/page.tsx`)
- **Access**: Admin users only (role-based access control)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time migration status dashboard
  - Progress bar showing migration completion percentage
  - One-click migration start
  - Migration result display with detailed statistics
  - Unmatched names table for manual review
  - Revert migration functionality with confirmation
  - Auto-refresh capability

- **Statistics Cards**:
  - Total Applications
  - Migrated Applications
  - Pending Migration

- **Migration Actions**:
  - Start Migration button (disabled when no pending applications)
  - Revert Migration button (with confirmation dialog)
  - Refresh button to update statistics

- **Unmatched Names Section**:
  - Table showing applications that couldn't be auto-matched
  - Quick link to view each application
  - Allows manual assignment through application edit page

#### 2. UI Components Created
- `Progress` component (`lc-workflow-frontend/src/components/ui/progress.tsx`)
  - Custom progress bar without external dependencies
  - Smooth transitions and dark mode support
  - Percentage-based width calculation

## Migration Workflow

### Automatic Migration
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/migrate-employees`
2. Reviews migration status and pending applications
3. Clicks "Start Migration" button
4. Backend executes migration script
5. Results displayed with success/failure counts
6. Unmatched names shown for manual review

### Manual Matching
1. Admin reviews unmatched names in the table
2. Clicks "View Application" to open application detail
3. Uses application edit page to assign employee
4. Assignment automatically marks application as migrated

### Revert Migration
1. Admin clicks "Revert Migration" button
2. Confirms action in dialog
3. Backend deactivates all migration-created assignments
4. Resets `portfolio_officer_migrated` flags
5. Applications can be re-migrated if needed

## Key Features

### Fuzzy Matching Algorithm
- Uses Levenshtein distance for string similarity
- Compares against both Khmer and Latin names
- 80% similarity threshold for matches
- Takes best match if multiple candidates exist

### Employee Code Generation
- Format: `EMP-YYYY-NNNN` (e.g., EMP-2024-0001)
- Year-based sequential numbering
- Automatic detection of highest existing number
- Prevents code collisions

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Detailed error logging
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Comprehensive error reporting in UI

### Data Integrity
- Prevents duplicate assignments
- Validates employee and application existence
- Maintains audit trail (assigned_by, notes)
- Soft delete for reversibility

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test migration script in dry-run mode
python scripts/migrate_portfolio_officers.py --dry-run

# Test API endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/migration-status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/migrate-employees
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Access `/admin/migrate-employees` as admin user
2. Verify statistics display correctly
3. Test migration start and result display
4. Test revert functionality
5. Verify unmatched names table
6. Test manual matching workflow

## Migration Best Practices

### Before Migration
1. Backup database
2. Run migration script in dry-run mode
3. Review dry-run results
4. Ensure all employees are in the system
5. Verify branch assignments are correct

### During Migration
1. Monitor migration progress
2. Check logs for errors
3. Note any unmatched names
4. Verify assignment creation

### After Migration
1. Review migration report
2. Manually match unmatched names
3. Verify application displays show employees
4. Test application edit functionality
5. Confirm backward compatibility

- Migration can be reverted if issues are discovered
- Manual matching provides flexibility for edge cases
- All operations are logged for audit purposes
