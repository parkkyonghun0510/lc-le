# Task 2: Backend Pydantic Schemas - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all Pydantic schemas for the Employee Assignment System, including Employee schemas, EmployeeAssignment schemas, and extensions to CustomerApplicationResponse.

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ Subtask 2.1: Create Employee Schemas
**Location:** `le-backend/app/schemas.py`

Implemented the following schemas:

1. **EmployeeBase** - Base schema with all employee fields and validation
   - `employee_code`: Unique identifier (1-20 chars, required)
   - `full_name_khmer`: Full name in Khmer (1-255 chars, required)
   - `full_name_latin`: Full name in Latin script (1-255 chars, required)
   - `phone_number`: Phone number (1-20 chars, required)
   - `email`: Optional email with EmailStr validation
   - `position`: Optional job position/title (max 100 chars)
   - `department_id`: Optional UUID reference to department
   - `branch_id`: Optional UUID reference to branch
   - `user_id`: Optional UUID reference to linked system user
   - `is_active`: Boolean flag (default: True)
   - `notes`: Optional additional notes

2. **EmployeeCreate** - Schema for creating new employees
   - Inherits all fields from EmployeeBase
   - All validations enforced at creation time

3. **EmployeeUpdate** - Schema for updating existing employees
   - All fields optional to support partial updates
   - Same validation rules as EmployeeBase when fields are provided

4. **EmployeeResponse** - Schema for employee responses with relationships
   - Includes all EmployeeBase fields
   - Additional fields:
     - `id`: UUID
     - `created_at`: Timestamp
     - `updated_at`: Timestamp
     - `department`: Optional DepartmentResponse relationship
     - `branch`: Optional BranchResponse relationship
     - `linked_user`: Optional UserSummary relationship
     - `assignment_count`: Computed field for number of active assignments
   - Implements `from_orm()` method for model conversion

**Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ 1.1: Employee registry with all required fields
- ✅ 1.2: Required fields (employee_code, names, phone) with validation
- ✅ 5.1: Optional user linking support
- ✅ 5.2: Relationship tracking between employees and users

### ✅ Subtask 2.2: Create EmployeeAssignment Schemas
**Location:** `le-backend/app/schemas.py`

Implemented the following schemas:

1. **AssignmentRole** - Enum for assignment roles
   - `PRIMARY_OFFICER = "primary_officer"`
   - `SECONDARY_OFFICER = "secondary_officer"`
   - `FIELD_OFFICER = "field_officer"`
   - `REVIEWER = "reviewer"`
   - `APPROVER = "approver"`

2. **EmployeeAssignmentBase** - Base schema for assignments
   - `employee_id`: UUID reference to employee (required)
   - `assignment_role`: AssignmentRole enum (required)
   - `notes`: Optional notes about the assignment

3. **EmployeeAssignmentCreate** - Schema for creating assignments
   - Inherits all fields from EmployeeAssignmentBase
   - Used when assigning employees to applications

4. **EmployeeAssignmentUpdate** - Schema for updating assignments
   - All fields optional for partial updates
   - `assignment_role`: Optional role update
   - `is_active`: Optional active status update
   - `notes`: Optional notes update

5. **EmployeeAssignmentResponse** - Schema for assignment responses
   - Includes all EmployeeAssignmentBase fields
   - Additional fields:
     - `id`: UUID
     - `application_id`: UUID reference to application
     - `assigned_at`: Timestamp of assignment
     - `assigned_by`: Optional UUID of user who made assignment
     - `is_active`: Boolean flag
     - `employee`: Full EmployeeResponse object with employee details
   - Implements `from_orm()` method for model conversion

**Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ 2.1: Employee assignment to applications
- ✅ 2.2: Multiple assignment roles support
- ✅ 2.5: Multiple employees with different roles

### ✅ Subtask 2.3: Extend CustomerApplicationResponse
**Location:** `le-backend/app/schemas.py`

Extended the existing `CustomerApplicationResponse` schema with:

1. **New Fields:**
   - `employee_assignments`: List of EmployeeAssignmentResponse objects (default: empty list)
   - `portfolio_officer_migrated`: Boolean flag indicating migration status (default: False)

2. **Updated from_orm() Method:**
   - Safely retrieves `portfolio_officer_migrated` field from model
   - Loads employee assignments if relationship is available
   - Filters to only include active assignments
   - Handles missing relationships gracefully
   - Returns empty list if assignments not loaded

**Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ 2.6: Display assigned employees in application responses
- ✅ 3.1: Migration path from portfolio_officer_name
- ✅ 3.4: Backward compatibility with legacy field

## Implementation Details

### Field Validation
All schemas include proper Pydantic validation:
- String length constraints (min_length, max_length)
- Email validation using EmailStr
- Required vs optional fields clearly defined
- Enum validation for assignment roles
- UUID validation for foreign key references

### Relationships
Schemas properly handle SQLAlchemy relationships:
- Department relationship in EmployeeResponse
- Branch relationship in EmployeeResponse
- Linked user relationship in EmployeeResponse
- Employee details in EmployeeAssignmentResponse
- Employee assignments in CustomerApplicationResponse

### from_orm() Methods
Custom from_orm() methods implemented for:
- **EmployeeResponse**: Converts Employee model to response schema
  - Safely loads department, branch, and linked_user relationships
  - Calculates assignment_count from assignments relationship
  - Handles missing relationships gracefully

- **EmployeeAssignmentResponse**: Converts ApplicationEmployeeAssignment model to response schema
  - Loads employee details if relationship is available
  - Includes all assignment metadata

- **CustomerApplicationResponse**: Extended to include employee assignments
  - Loads employee_assignments relationship
  - Filters to only active assignments
  - Maintains backward compatibility

### Model Rebuild
All new schemas added to the `_models_to_rebuild` list to ensure forward references are properly resolved:
- EmployeeBase
- EmployeeCreate
- EmployeeUpdate
- EmployeeResponse
- EmployeeAssignmentBase
- EmployeeAssignmentCreate
- EmployeeAssignmentUpdate
- EmployeeAssignmentResponse

## Testing

### Verification Test
Created `test_employee_schemas_simple.py` to verify:
- ✅ All schema classes are defined
- ✅ All required fields are present with correct validation
- ✅ AssignmentRole enum has all 5 roles
- ✅ from_orm() methods are implemented
- ✅ CustomerApplicationResponse extensions are present
- ✅ All schemas added to model rebuild list

**Test Results:** All tests passed ✅

## Files Modified
1. `le-backend/app/schemas.py` - Added all employee and assignment schemas

## Files Created
1. `le-backend/test_employee_schemas.py` - Full schema instantiation test
2. `le-backend/test_employee_schemas_simple.py` - Structure verification test
3. `le-backend/TASK_2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps
The schemas are now ready for use in:
- Task 3: Employee service layer implementation
- Task 4: Employee API endpoints
- Task 5: Application endpoint updates
