# Task 3: Employee Service Layer - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete employee service layer for the Employee Assignment System, including both `EmployeeService` and `EmployeeAssignmentService` classes.

## Completed Components

### 1. EmployeeService (`le-backend/app/services/employee_service.py`)

Implemented all required methods:

#### Core CRUD Operations
- ✅ `create_employee()` - Creates new employee with validation
  - Validates unique employee_code
  - Validates user_id not already linked
  - Logs creation with audit trail
  
- ✅ `get_employee_by_id()` - Retrieves employee by UUID
  - Optional relationship eager loading
  - Returns None if not found
  
- ✅ `get_employee_by_code()` - Retrieves employee by employee code
  - Optional relationship eager loading
  - Useful for lookups and validation
  
- ✅ `update_employee()` - Updates employee information
  - Validates unique employee_code on change
  - Validates user_id not already linked on change
  - Updates audit fields
  
- ✅ `deactivate_employee()` - Soft delete employee
  - Sets is_active to False
  - Preserves historical data

#### Search and Listing
- ✅ `list_employees()` - Paginated employee list
  - Supports pagination (page, size)
  - Search by name (Khmer/Latin) or code using ILIKE
  - Filter by department_id, branch_id, is_active
  - Returns tuple of (employees, total_count)
  - Eager loads relationships
  
- ✅ `search_employees()` - Quick search for employees
  - ILIKE search on names and code
  - Filter by active status
  - Configurable result limit
  - Optimized for autocomplete/typeahead

#### Advanced Features
- ✅ `link_employee_to_user()` - Links employee to system user
  - Validates user exists
  - Validates user not already linked to another employee
  - Enables single source of truth for staff
  
- ✅ `get_employee_workload()` - Retrieves workload statistics
  - Counts assignments by application status
  - Optional status filter
  - Returns detailed workload breakdown

### 2. EmployeeAssignmentService (`le-backend/app/services/employee_assignment_service.py`)

Implemented all required methods:

#### Assignment Management
- ✅ `assign_employee()` - Assigns employee to application
  - Validates employee exists and is active
  - Validates application exists
  - **Branch validation**: Ensures employee and application are in same branch
  - Prevents duplicate assignments (same employee, application, role)
  - Logs assignment with assigned_by user
  
- ✅ `get_application_assignments()` - Gets all assignments for an application
  - Optional active_only filter
  - Eager loads employee details and relationships
  
- ✅ `get_employee_assignments()` - Gets all assignments for an employee
  - Optional active_only filter
  - Eager loads application details
  
- ✅ `update_assignment()` - Updates assignment details
  - Change assignment role
  - Update notes
  - Toggle active status
  
- ✅ `remove_assignment()` - Soft delete assignment
  - Sets is_active to False
  - Preserves historical data

#### Data Migration
- ✅ `migrate_portfolio_officer_name()` - Migrates legacy data
  - Matches portfolio_officer_name to existing employees
  - Uses fuzzy matching on Khmer and Latin names
  - Creates assignment with role='primary_officer'
  - Marks application as migrated
  - Handles cases where no match found
  - Prevents duplicate migrations

## Key Features Implemented

### Validation
- ✅ Unique employee_code enforcement
- ✅ User linking validation (one user per employee)
- ✅ Active employee validation for assignments
- ✅ Branch matching validation for assignments
- ✅ Duplicate assignment prevention

### Error Handling
- ✅ Custom exception classes (NotFoundError, ConflictError)
- ✅ HTTPException integration for FastAPI
- ✅ Detailed error messages with context
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ Eager loading with selectinload for relationships
- ✅ Efficient ILIKE queries for search
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Indexed queries on key fields

### Audit Trail
- ✅ created_by and updated_by tracking
- ✅ assigned_by tracking for assignments
- ✅ Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at, assigned_at)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging of all operations

## Testing

### Import Verification
```bash
python test_service_imports.py
```
Result: ✅ All imports and methods verified successfully

### Syntax Validation
```bash
python -m py_compile app/services/employee_service.py app/services/employee_assignment_service.py
```
Result: ✅ No syntax errors

### Diagnostics
```bash
getDiagnostics(['employee_service.py', 'employee_assignment_service.py'])
```
Result: ✅ No diagnostics found

## Code Quality

### Documentation

## Next Steps
The service layer is complete and ready for:
1. API endpoint implementation (Task 4)
2. Frontend integration (Tasks 6-8)
3. Unit testing (Task 13.1)
4. Integration testing (Task 13.2)

## Files Created
1. `le-backend/app/services/employee_service.py` (462 lines)
2. `le-backend/app/services/employee_assignment_service.py` (398 lines)
3. `le-backend/test_service_imports.py` (verification script)
4. `le-backend/TASK_3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Notes
- All methods follow async/await patterns
- Services use dependency injection for database sessions
- Error handling is consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Branch validation ensures data integrity across the system
- Migration support enables smooth transition from legacy data
