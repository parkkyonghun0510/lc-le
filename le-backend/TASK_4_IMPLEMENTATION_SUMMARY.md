#### 4.3 Employee Reporting Endpoints

11. **GET /api/employees/{employee_id}/workload**
    - Get workload statistics for an employee
    - Permission: `view_employee_reports` (admin, manager)
    - Query params: status_filter, date_from, date_to
    - Branch access control for non-admin users
    - Returns: Assignment counts grouped by status

12. **GET /api/employees/reports/workload-summary**
    - Get workload summary for all employees
    - Permission: `view_employee_reports` (admin, manager)
    - Query params: department_id, branch_id, status_filter, date_from, date_to
    - Branch filtering for non-admin users
    - Returns: Summary with employee details and workload data

## Permission Model

The router implements role-based access control:

- **manage_employees**: admin, manager
  - Create, update, delete employees
  
- **view_employees**: admin, manager, officer
  - View employee lists and details
  - View assignments
  
- **assign_employees**: admin, manager, officer
  - Create, update, remove assignments
  
- **view_employee_reports**: admin, manager
  - View workload statistics and reports

## Branch-Based Access Control

Non-admin users are restricted to their branch:
- Employee lists filtered by user's branch
- Cannot view employees from other branches
- Cannot view assignments for employees from other branches
- Workload reports filtered by user's branch

## Validation Rules

1. **Employee Creation**
   - Unique employee_code required
   - Required fields: employee_code, full_name_khmer, full_name_latin, phone_number

2. **Employee Assignment**
   - Employee must exist and be active
   - Application must exist
   - Employee and application must be in same branch
   - No duplicate assignments (same employee, application, role)

3. **Branch Validation**
   - Enforced at assignment creation
   - Returns 400 error if branches don't match

## Error Handling

All endpoints include comprehensive error handling:
- 400 Bad Request: Validation errors, inactive employee, branch mismatch
- 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions, branch access denied
- 404 Not Found: Employee or application not found
- 409 Conflict: Duplicate employee_code or assignment
- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected errors

## Logging

All operations are logged with:
- User ID performing the action
- Employee/assignment ID
- Action type (create, update, delete, assign)

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
1. **test_employee_router.py**: Verifies all dependencies and imports
2. **test_router_routes.py**: Lists all registered routes

Test results:
- ✓ All 12 endpoints registered correctly
- ✓ All service methods available
- ✓ All schemas importable
- ✓ Router registered in main.py

## Next Steps

The employee API endpoints are now complete and ready for frontend integration. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- Task 5: Update application endpoints with employee assignments
- Task 6: Frontend TypeScript types for employees
- Task 7: Frontend API hooks for employees
- Task 8: Frontend employee management UI

## API Documentation

The router is fully documented with:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Permission requirements
- Query parameter descriptions
- Response models
- Validation rules
- Error codes

Access the interactive API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Notes

1. All endpoints use async/await for database operations
2. Eager loading with selectinload prevents N+1 queries
3. Assignment counts are calculated dynamically
4. Soft delete pattern used for employees and assignments
5. Comprehensive logging for audit trail
6. Branch-based access control enforced throughout
