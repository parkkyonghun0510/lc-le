# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Update Application Endpoints with Employee Assignments

## Overview
Successfully implemented integration of employee assignments with application endpoints, enabling applications to be associated with multiple employees in different roles while maintaining backward compatibility with the legacy `portfolio_officer_name` field.

## Completed Tasks

### 5.1 Modify Application Create Endpoint ✅
**File:** `le-backend/app/routers/applications.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `CustomerApplicationCreate` schema to accept optional `employee_assignments` list
- Modified `create_application` endpoint to:
  - Extract employee assignments from request data
  - Validate each employee (exists, is active, same branch)
  - Create assignments using `EmployeeAssignmentService`
  - Set `portfolio_officer_migrated` flag to `True` when assignments are provided
  - Rollback application creation if any assignment fails
  - Maintain backward compatibility with `portfolio_officer_name` field

**Validation Logic:**
- Employee must exist in the database
- Employee must be active (`is_active=True`)
- Employee must belong to the same branch as the application (if branch is specified)
- Graceful error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 5.2 Modify Application Update Endpoint ✅
**File:** `le-backend/app/routers/applications.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `CustomerApplicationUpdate` schema to accept optional `employee_assignments` list
- Modified `update_application` endpoint to:
  - Load existing employee assignments with eager loading
  - Compare existing vs new assignments
  - Deactivate removed assignments (soft delete)
  - Add new assignments with validation
  - Update `portfolio_officer_migrated` flag when assignments are added
  - Maintain backward compatibility with `portfolio_officer_name` updates

**Update Strategy:**
- Builds maps of existing and new assignments by `(employee_id, assignment_role)` key
- Removes assignments not in the new list
- Adds assignments not in the existing list
- Preserves assignments that exist in both lists

### 5.3 Modify Application Get Endpoints ✅
**Files:** `le-backend/app/routers/applications.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `get_application` endpoint:
  - Added `selectinload` for `employee_assignments` relationship
  - Nested `selectinload` for `employee.department` and `employee.branch`
  - Prevents N+1 query problems

- Updated `list_applications` endpoint:
  - Added same eager loading strategy for employee assignments
  - Ensures all applications in list include assignment data

**Performance Optimization:**
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `selectinload` for efficient eager loading
- Loads nested relationships (employee → department, employee → branch) in single query
- Avoids N+1 query problems when fetching multiple applications

## Schema Updates

### CustomerApplicationCreate
```python
class CustomerApplicationCreate(CustomerApplicationBase):
    employee_assignments: Optional[List['EmployeeAssignmentCreate']] = Field(
        default=None, 
        description="Optional list of employee assignments"
    )
```

### CustomerApplicationUpdate
```python
class CustomerApplicationUpdate(CustomerApplicationBase):
    status: Optional[str] = None
    employee_assignments: Optional[List['EmployeeAssignmentCreate']] = Field(
        default=None, 
        description="Optional list of employee assignments"
    )
```

### CustomerApplicationResponse
Already includes:
```python
employee_assignments: List['EmployeeAssignmentResponse'] = Field(
    default_factory=list, 
    description="Assigned employees"
)
portfolio_officer_migrated: bool = Field(
    default=False, 
    description="Whether portfolio_officer_name has been migrated to employee assignments"
)
```

## API Behavior

### Creating Application with Employee Assignments
```json
POST /api/v1/applications
{
  "id_number": "123456789",
  "full_name_latin": "John Doe",
  "phone": "012345678",
  "requested_amount": 10000.0,
  "product_type": "personal_loan",
  "loan_purposes": ["business"],
  "employee_assignments": [
    {
      "employee_id": "uuid-here",
      "assignment_role": "primary_officer",
      "notes": "Primary officer for this application"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response includes:**
- `employee_assignments`: Array of assignment objects with full employee details
- `portfolio_officer_migrated`: `true`
- `portfolio_officer_name`: Can still be set for backward compatibility

### Updating Application Employee Assignments
```json
PUT /api/v1/applications/{id}
{
  "employee_assignments": [
    {
      "employee_id": "uuid-here",
      "assignment_role": "primary_officer"
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "another-uuid",
      "assignment_role": "secondary_officer"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Removes assignments not in the new list (soft delete)
- Adds new assignments
- Updates `portfolio_officer_migrated` to `true`

### Getting Application with Assignments
```json
GET /api/v1/applications/{id}
```

**Response includes:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "full_name_latin": "John Doe",
  "portfolio_officer_name": "Legacy Name",
  "portfolio_officer_migrated": true,
  "employee_assignments": [
    {
      "id": "assignment-uuid",
      "employee_id": "employee-uuid",
      "assignment_role": "primary_officer",
      "assigned_at": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
      "is_active": true,
      "employee": {
        "id": "employee-uuid",
        "employee_code": "EMP001",
        "full_name_khmer": "តេស្ត",
        "full_name_latin": "Test Employee",
        "department": {...},
        "branch": {...}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors (400 Bad Request)
- Employee not found
- Employee is inactive
- Employee branch doesn't match application branch
- Invalid employee ID format

### Example Error Responses:
```json
{
  "detail": "Employee with ID {id} not found"
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Cannot assign inactive employee: John Doe"
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Employee John Doe must belong to the same branch as the application"
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Field Support
- `portfolio_officer_name` field is preserved and still functional
- Applications can be created/updated with `portfolio_officer_name` only
- Both fields can coexist in the same application
- `portfolio_officer_migrated` flag indicates migration status

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Applications use `portfolio_officer_name` (legacy)
   - `portfolio_officer_migrated = false`
   - `employee_assignments = []`

2. **Phase 2**: Applications use both fields (transition)
   - `portfolio_officer_migrated = true`
   - `employee_assignments = [...]`
   - `portfolio_officer_name` still visible for reference

3. **Phase 3**: Applications use only `employee_assignments` (future)
   - `portfolio_officer_migrated = true`
   - `employee_assignments = [...]`
   - `portfolio_officer_name` can be null or empty

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive tests in `test_application_assignments_simple.py`:

1. **Test Application with Employee Assignments**
   - Creates application with employee assignment
   - Verifies assignment is stored correctly
   - Checks `portfolio_officer_migrated` flag
   - Validates eager loading of relationships

2. **Test Backward Compatibility**
   - Creates application with legacy `portfolio_officer_name`
   - Verifies legacy field is preserved
   - Confirms no assignments are created
   - Checks `portfolio_officer_migrated` is false

### Test Results

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Uses `selectinload` for efficient relationship loading
- Prevents N+1 query problems
- Loads nested relationships in single query batch
- Minimal database round trips

### Database Impact
- No additional indexes required (already created in Task 1)
- Efficient foreign key lookups
- Soft delete pattern for assignments (no data loss)

## Security Considerations

### Validation
- Employee existence check before assignment
- Active status verification
- Branch-based access control
- User permission checks (inherited from existing endpoint security)

### Data Integrity
- Transaction rollback on assignment failure
- Atomic operations (application + assignments)
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Audit trail via `assigned_by` field

## Integration Points

### Services Used
- `EmployeeService.get_employee_by_id()` - Employee validation
- `EmployeeAssignmentService.assign_employee()` - Create assignments
- `EmployeeAssignmentService.remove_assignment()` - Soft delete assignments

### Models Involved
- `CustomerApplication` - Main application model
- `Employee` - Employee registry
- `ApplicationEmployeeAssignment` - Assignment junction table
- `User` - Current user for permissions and audit
- `Branch` - Branch validation
- `Department` - Department relationships

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Tasks
1. **Task 6**: Frontend TypeScript types for employees
2. **Task 7**: Frontend API hooks for employees
3. **Task 8**: Frontend employee management UI
4. **Task 9**: Frontend employee selector component
5. **Task 11**: Data migration utilities for legacy data

### Future Enhancements
- Bulk assignment operations
