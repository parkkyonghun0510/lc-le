## Integration with Main Application

The feature flags system has been integrated into the main FastAPI application:

```python
# Added to le-backend/app/main.py
from app.routers import feature_flags
app.include_router(feature_flags.router, prefix="/api/v1/feature-flags", tags=["feature-flags"])
```

## Usage Examples

### Feature Flag Evaluation

```python
from app.core.feature_flags import is_feature_enabled

# Check if enhanced malware scanning is enabled for a user
if is_feature_enabled("enhanced_malware_scanning", user_id=str(user.id), user_role=user.role):
    # Use enhanced scanning
    result = await enhanced_malware_scan(file_content)
else:
    # Use basic scanning
    result = await basic_malware_scan(file_content)
```

### Feature Flag Decorator

```python
from app.core.feature_flags import feature_flag

@feature_flag("real_time_updates", default=False)
async def send_real_time_update(data, current_user):
    # This function only executes if the flag is enabled
    await realtime_service.send_update(data)
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Check if a feature is enabled for current user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     https://api.example.com/api/v1/feature-flags/enhanced_malware_scanning/check

# Get all enabled flags for current user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     https://api.example.com/api/v1/feature-flags/user/flags

# Admin: Set rollout percentage
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.example.com/api/v1/feature-flags/real_time_updates/rollout?percentage=50"
```

## Benefits and Impact

- Includes verification steps to ensure successful deployment
- Documents monitoring setup for operational visibility

### 3. Gradual Feature Rollout
- Enables safe deployment of new features
- Supports A/B testing and experimentation
- Allows quick rollback of problematic features
- Provides fine-grained control over feature availability

### 4. Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive troubleshooting reduces downtime

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Feature flags configuration
FEATURE_FLAGS_CONFIG=/path/to/feature_flags.json

# Enable specific features
ENABLE_MALWARE_SCANNING=true
ENABLE_FILE_ENCRYPTION=true
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
ENABLE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES=true
ENABLE_COMPREHENSIVE_HEALTH_CHECKS=true
```

### Feature Flags Configuration File

The system automatically creates a `feature_flags.json` file with default system flags. This file can be manually edited or managed through the API.

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin-Only Management**: Only admin users can create, update, or delete feature flags
2. **Audit Logging**: All feature flag changes are logged with user context
3. **Secure Evaluation**: Flag evaluation considers user roles and permissions
4. **Configuration Protection**: Feature flag configuration files should be protected

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Flag Usage Statistics**: Track which flags are enabled and for how many users
2. **Performance Impact**: Monitor the performance impact of flag evaluation
3. **Rollout Monitoring**: Track the success of gradual rollouts
4. **Error Tracking**: Monitor errors related to feature flag evaluation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Storage**: Move from JSON file to database storage for better scalability
2. **UI Dashboard**: Create a web interface for feature flag management
3. **Advanced Targeting**: Add more sophisticated targeting rules
4. **Integration Testing**: Automated testing of feature flag combinations
5. **Metrics Integration**: Better integration with monitoring systems

## Conclusion

Task 16 has successfully implemented comprehensive API documentation, deployment procedures, troubleshooting guides, and a feature flag system. This provides the foundation for safe, gradual rollout of new functionality while maintaining system stability and operational excellence.

The implementation supports the system stability improvements by:
- Enabling gradual rollout of security enhancements
- Providing comprehensive operational documentation
- Supporting safe deployment and rollback procedures
- Facilitating troubleshooting and issue resolution
- Enabling monitoring and observability of new features

All components are production-ready and can be immediately used to support the enhanced LC Workflow API system.
