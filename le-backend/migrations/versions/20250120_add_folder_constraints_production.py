Revision ID: 20250120_folder_constraints
Revises: 20250120_add_alert_logs_table
Create Date: 2025-01-20 15:00:00.000000

This migration implements the database constraints required for Task 17:
- Unique constraints for preventing duplicate parent folders
- Constraint ensuring folder belongs to same application as parent
- Constraint ensuring files belong to same application as their folder
- Comprehensive cleanup of existing duplicates before applying constraints
